#This is the example for creating a colorboard. from PIL import Image img = Image.new(&amp;#39;RGB&amp;#39;, (60, 30), &amp;#39;red&amp;#39;) img.save(&amp;#39;pil_red.png&amp;#39;) Create your own colorboard! Choose your favorite color and make a color board to play with! Here are some example colors you can choose from, but you can also pick your own color.</description></item><item><title>Activity 2: Modify your color board</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-2/</guid><description>Example one: Make a diagonal #This creates the original colorboard. from PIL import Image img = Image.new(&amp;#39;RGB&amp;#39;, (60, 30), &amp;#39;red&amp;#39;) img.save(&amp;#39;pil_red.png&amp;#39;) #This uses a nested while loop to change the picture. x = 0 y = 0 while x &amp;lt; 10: while y &amp;lt; 20: img.putpixel( (x,y), (0, 0, 0)) x += 1 y += 1 img.save(&amp;#39;pil_red.png&amp;#39;) This is the picture before changing. This is the picture after changing. Example two: Make a rectangle.</description></item><item><title>Activity 3: Challenge: Design new elements</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-3/</guid><description>Using loops, you can actually design your own elements on the colorboard. You can design your own logo or anything you want on this color board. Here is an example we provided for you.
Example: make an N. #This creates the original colorboard. from PIL import Image img = Image.new(&amp;#39;RGB&amp;#39;, (60, 30), &amp;#39;white&amp;#39;) #This uses nested while loop to change the colorboard. #Left vertical line for x in range(10, 15): for y in range(5, 25): img.</description></item><item><title>Activity 4: Create Basic Filter</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-4/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-4/</guid><description>Now that we understand more about pixels and images, we can start to learn how to design your own filter on the image. Let us see some examples on how to design a basic filter on your image.
Example for blue filter We want to add a blue filter on the cute cat above. Let's see how to achieve that. # We need to import PIL package to allow manipulation with pixels.</description></item><item><title>Activity 5: More advanced filters</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-5/</guid><description>In the last section, we saw an example of creating a blue filter and thought about how to create the grey filter. Now, let us create our grey filter together.
Example - Create a grey filter Let us change the original cat image below with our grey filter together!
# We need to import PIL package to allow manipulation with pixels. from PIL import Image # Open the cat image img = Image.</description></item><item><title>Activity 6: Crop Image</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-6/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-6/</guid><description>In this section, we will start to learn how to crop your image.
Example - Crop cat into half Now, let us crop out the right half of the cat image
# We need to import PIL package to allow manipulation with pixels. from PIL import Image # Open the cat image img = Image.open(&amp;#34;cat.png&amp;#34;) width = img.size[0] height = img.size[1] # Set up a new image with the half width and height newimg = Image.</description></item><item><title>Activity 7: Change the background of image</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-7/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-7/</guid><description>In this section, we will start to learn how to change the simple background of your image using pixels.
Example - Change background color Let us change the background color of Nuvi to pink. from PIL import Image # Open the Nuvi image img = Image.open(&amp;#34;nuevo.png&amp;#34;) width = img.size[0] height = img.size[1] # Set up a new image with width and height newimg = Image.new(&amp;#39;RGB&amp;#39;,(width,height)) # Set the pixels for the new image colorpink = (244,114,208) coloryellow = img.</description></item><item><title>Activity 8: Flip your image</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-8/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-8/</guid><description>In this section, we will start to learn how to flip your image using pixels.
Example - Flip your image upside down Let us flip the cat upside down. Flipping the image upside down is the same as creating a symmetrical image with respect to the horizontal central line, which is the black line in the following image.
# We need to import PIL package to manipulation with pixels.</description></item><item><title>Activity 9: Rotate your image</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-9/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-9/</guid><description>In this section, we will start to learn how to rotate your image using pixels.
Example - Rotate your image 180 degree clock-wise Let us rotate our cat 180 degrees clock-wise. # We need to import PIL package to allow manipulation with pixels. from PIL import Image # Open the cat image img = Image.open(&amp;#34;cat.png&amp;#34;) width = img.size[0] height = img.size[1] # Set up a new image with the half width and height newimg = Image.</description></item><item><title>Activity 10: Making a meme!</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-10/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-10/</guid><description>One other thing we can do to enhance our image is to add text. We can do that by utilizing the Pillow ImageDraw module. Let’s import that at the top of our file along with our other import statements.
from PIL import Image from PIL import ImageFilter from PIL import ImageDraw To allow us to add text, we must redraw the same image we used earlier. Let’s do that using the draw() function, which takes in an image object.</description></item><item><title>Activity 11: Challenge: Make your own image</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-11/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-11/</guid><description>In this section, we will take what you have learned so far to create and change your own picture! In this section, you are free to make any combination of basic colorboards, drawing elements, filters, cropping, flipping, changing colors or text.
Challenge - Make your own image In the following replit, we provide you some images you can play around with. You are also welcome to add your own images.</description></item></channel></rss>
