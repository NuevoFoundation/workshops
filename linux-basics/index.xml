What is a virtual machine? A virtual machine (commonly called a VM) is a computer file (called an image), that behaves like an actual computer.
In other words, it is a computer inside a computer. It runs in a window, like any other program.
This gives you the same experience on a VM as you would on a regular computer.</description></item><item><title>Using Virtual Machines Part 2</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/vm-import-setup/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/vm-import-setup/</guid><description>Excellent work on preparing the host environment! Now let&amp;rsquo;s load the hacked computer&amp;rsquo;s image as a VM.
What is an image? Images come in a variety of types. We have photographs, which are images. Computer images are very similar. Both are copies of things from a single point in time. We will be working with a copy of a computer that has been acting weird. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry though, this won&amp;rsquo;t hurt your computer!</description></item><item><title>Starting up the Virtual Machine</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/launch-vm/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/launch-vm/</guid><description>Now that everything is installed, let&amp;rsquo;s launch the virtual machine!
Starting the VM This is pretty simple in VirtualBox. Just double-click on the VM that we created in the previous step and off you go! As the virtual machine is getting started, it may show some warnings like in the following image. It is safe to ignore these.
Sign into the VM First you will need to log in. Use these credentials to get started!</description></item><item><title>Activity 1 - Determine User Account</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/activity-1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/activity-1/</guid><description>Now we are at the command line. Let&amp;rsquo;s test a simple command to show us the user account.
What are user accounts? Every user in Linux has a user account. These are used to uniquely identify each user.
For example, say you and your friend, Nuvi, share a computer. You and Nuvi might create separate user accounts to keep track of which files belong to which of you and to ensure that none of you accidentally changes anything important.</description></item><item><title>Activity 2 - Determine User Location</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/activity-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/activity-2/</guid><description>Before we can stop the hackers, we need to learn to navigate the Linux filesystem.
What is a filesystem? A filesystem is a structured collection of files and data on a computer disk or drive. The highest level of a filesystem is referred to as the &amp;ldquo;root&amp;rdquo;. You can think of it as the beginning of the filesystem.
Fun fact: filesystems are often described as a &amp;ldquo;tree&amp;rdquo;. This is because the filesystem looks like an upside down tree with each folder as a branch or leaf.</description></item><item><title>Answer Key - Linux Basics</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/answer-key/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/answer-key/</guid><description>Activity 1 whoami Activity 2 pwd cd Desktop cd..

How do you explore the directory? To see the files in the current directory, we use the ls command. It means &amp;ldquo;List&amp;rdquo;.
Try it:
ls How do I get more info about the files in this directory? Try it:
ls -l The -l flag in the above command tells ls to list long form information.</description></item><item><title>Activity 4 - Note Taking Practice</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/activity-4/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/activity-4/</guid><description>As a cybersecurity engineer, it is important to take a lot of notes. These are helpful for future reference to understand how the hack happened. Let&amp;rsquo;s step up our workspace!
What if I want to create a new directory? To practice creating a new directory, use the command mkdir (meaning &amp;ldquo;Make Directory&amp;rdquo;) in the following format: mkdir new_directory_name.
Let&amp;rsquo;s make a directory called files by typing the command below:</description></item><item><title>Activity 5 - Secure User Permissions</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/activity-5/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/activity-5/</guid><description>Oh no. Some of our files might have been messed with! Letâ€™s secure our notes, file1. We don&amp;rsquo;t want a hacker to mess with these!
How do we limit access to our files? By giving users &amp;ldquo;permissions&amp;rdquo; on files!
Permissions are a way for the computer to determine who has access to files and what they can do with those files.
In Linux, there are three common types of access to a file that a user might request: &amp;ldquo;read&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;write&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;execute&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Activity 6 - A BAD File</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/activity-6/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/activity-6/</guid><description>I know I had a file secret-message.txt with one of my favorite quotes in it. &amp;ldquo;Do. Or do not. There is no try.&amp;rdquo; Can you help me find it?
Searching for a pattern in a file? grep (global search for regular expression and print the result) is a command used to search for text within files. There are different flags or options that can change how it is used.</description></item><item><title>Activity 7 - What's wrong with the file?</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/activity-7/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/activity-7/</guid><description>Malware can be dangerous! Don&amp;rsquo;t open it right away! Instead let&amp;rsquo;s use the command line to take a peek.
For files that we aren&amp;rsquo;t sure about, we need to peek at them so we don&amp;rsquo;t accidentally open a virus.
How can we look at the first lines of the file? Sometimes you just need to look at the beginning of a file. The command head shows the first line of a file.</description></item><item><title>Activity 8 - What's different?</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/activity-8/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/activity-8/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the secret message to make sure this weird malware.sh file hasn&amp;rsquo;t done anything to it!
Differences Do we know a command that can help us find the location of the secret-message.txt file?
Let&amp;rsquo;s move into that directory and let&amp;rsquo;s check for the quote &amp;ldquo;Do. Or do not. There is no try.&amp;rdquo; from earlier. Do you remember what command can help us check?
This file usually has good and fun quotes, but there seems to be lots of changes.</description></item><item><title>Activity 9 - Remove the Bad File</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/activity-9/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/activity-9/</guid><description>So malware.sh is definitely a bad file left by the hackers. We need to remove it and the directory holding it!
Remove the bad file! rm is a command that removes files.
The format is: rm [filename].
rm permanently removes the file.
Remove the file we have decided is causing our problems. How can we check that the file was fully removed?
What if we need to remove a directory?</description></item><item><title>Activity 10 - Let's move and replace</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/activity-10/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/activity-10/</guid><description>Great, now that the hackers&amp;rsquo; malicious file won&amp;rsquo;t cause us any more headaches, let&amp;rsquo;s restore the old file so things will run smoothly again.
How to fix the secret-message The command mv can also be used to replace the destination file with the source file.
The format is: mv [source filename] [destination name].
Replace the messed up secret message with the backup that we found earlier.
Let&amp;rsquo;s move the file into the new directory that we made.</description></item><item><title>Activity 11 - Store and protect files</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/activity-11/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/activity-11/</guid><description>Thanks so much for helping us fix my machine! Now let&amp;rsquo;s get everything up into one nice package.
Secure your files, so they don&amp;rsquo;t get tampered with again tar is a command that creates and extracts archived files.
An archive is a collection of archive files. An archive file holds the compressed data of one or more files.
zip is a command that compresses a set of files. The format is: zip [name of zip file] [filenames to be zipped]</description></item><item><title>Closing</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/closing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/closing/</guid><description>Congratulations!
