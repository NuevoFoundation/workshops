Every computer must have at least one OS to run other programs. The OS helps you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer\u0026rsquo;s language.\nMicrosoft Windows is the OS you are probably most familiar with using at home. Another common one you might have seen is Mac OS from Apple. There are many options out there, but today we will using a Linux based OS, called Kali Linux. It is a popular OS for security experts and hackers!\nLinux is a free and open source operating system based on Unix standards which provides a programming interface as well as user interface compatibility. Kali adds to Linux a variety of applications that are used in computer security.\nThe biggest differnce between Windows and Linux is what they are best at doing. Windows is really good for multimedia and games! Mac OS falls between Windows and Linux. It is great for multimedia too, but cannot play all the games.

If you\u0026rsquo;re reading this, it hopefully means that you\u0026rsquo;re here to learn JavaScript 😁🥳. Whether this is your first time coding or you want a way to quickly pick up a new language - you\u0026rsquo;re in the right place! Get ready to discover the power of programming and have fun.\nWhat is Code? We can\u0026rsquo;t learn how to code without first understanding what exactly code is. Think of your favorite website, if you can\u0026rsquo;t think of one let\u0026rsquo;s take NuevoFoundation.org. As a user, all you have to do is type the web address in your browser and before you know it - ta da! - the website appears, with all of its pretty colors and pictures of nuvi.\nEasy right? Not exactly, behind what seems like a simple interaction there exists hundreds - if not thousands! - lines of code to make it all work. Let\u0026rsquo;s take just one step of this interaction, searching and going to the Nuevo Foundation website. There are billions of websites (1.7 billion last time I checked), how does your browser get to the website you want so quickly? Think about that for a second\u0026hellip;\nThere are people who coded that, and people that coded your browser, and the Nuvi website, and this curriculum you\u0026rsquo;re reading, and \u0026hellip; well you get the point. Code is how we humans design and build things like websites, apps, and games. It\u0026rsquo;s the language we use to tell computers what to do.\nWhat is JavaScript and what is it used for? Just like there exists a bunch of human languages, there exists a bunch of programming languages. Perhaps you\u0026rsquo;ve heard of some of them, such as Python or Java. Each programming language has its strengths and purposes - for example, CSS is used for styling websites, Python is really good for data science, and so on.\nJavaScript is sometimes referred to as the \u0026ldquo;language of the web.\u0026rdquo; Pretty much any website you can think of uses JavaScript in some way of form. JavaScript is really good at controlling website behavior, for example, controlling what happens when you click a button or transferring data between pages.\nThe good thing is that once you learn one language, you can learn another one pretty quick as the fundamentals tend to stay the same.\nEnvironment Set Up Environment? I thought this was a coding workshop?\nEnvironment is just what programmers like to call their setup for coding. You know how you use things like Microsoft Word or Google Docs to write essays? You can think of that as your \u0026ldquo;writing essay\u0026rdquo; environment.\nFor programmers, there exists applications called IDEs, which stand for Integrated Development Environment. These are the types of applications that let us write and run code.\nFor this workshop, we will be using playcode.io.\nOnce you open playcode.io, there are a few things you need to do before we get started:\n close all files in the top left except for script.js. Delete everything in the script.js file. Turn off live by clicking once on the live button in the top right.  If you\u0026rsquo;ve done all the above steps correctly, your screen should look like this: Now we are finally ready to go and learn some JavaScript!\n"},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-pixel/activities/activity-1/","title":"Activity 1: Create a color board","tags":[],"description":"","content":" Example for basic colorboard Here is an example of how to make a color board with the color red, a width of 60, and a length of 30.\n#This is the example for creating a colorboard. from PIL import Image img = Image.new(\u0026#39;RGB\u0026#39;, (60, 30), \u0026#39;red\u0026#39;) img.save(\u0026#39;pil_red.png\u0026#39;) Create your own colorboard!

Functions are blocks of code that do just that. A function is a set of instructions that we give to the computer to store, and it can take in parameters (input data) and output data. A function in Python looks like this:\nLet’s analyze this piece of code. The def tells the computer that you are writing a function. We give it a name, in this case, my_function. Then, we put a colon (the : symbol) to indicate that the function is starting. The next two lines are two spaces away from the left side of the text editor \u0026ndash; this tells the computer that these lines are part of the function definition. This is very important, so don\u0026rsquo;t miss out on this detail!\nPress run.\nYou will notice that nothing happens. This is only a function definition - we need to “call” the function to run the code within the function. In other words, the computer understands the instructions, but you need you tell the computer to do the given instructions. You can call my_function() anywhere, as long as it is after the function is defined. Place my_function() below the function definition, with no spaces in front. Your code should look like this:\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to remove the two spaces before calling my_function(). You might run into unexpected behavior otherwise!\n You might be familiar with the math definition of a function; for example, the function 𝒇(𝒙) = 3𝒙. It takes an input value, 𝒙, and transforms the value by multiplying it by 3. Similarly, in python, you can also give input values (called parameters) to a function and return (or produce) an output value. An example of a Python function which triples a given number is given below:\nNumber is the name of the parameter (input) that we are giving to the function triple. The word int tells the computer that the parameter number is an integer. The return word is only used within functions, and allows the function to output a value. In this case the triple function returns (outputs) number * 3, which then can be stored in a variable and printed. If the function variable.

So, the first if- statement will print yes.\nHowever, we can see that y is not less than x, so it evaluates to false. The inside of the if statement will not be executed then. The same applies for the if statement evaluating if x is equal to 10. We see that x is equal to 0, so this expression is false, and the inside of the if statement won’t be executed.\nElse statements Now that we know how to use if statements to conditionally execute a single statement or multiple statements, let’s see what else we can do!\nSometimes, you need to evaluate a condition in order to act accordingly if it is true, but if it false we act differently. Here is the simplest form of the else statement.\nThis is really like the if statement! However here, if the if statement is false (not truthful), the program will automatically execute the statement2 in the else statement.\nA real-life example is if I’m hungry, I’ll eat. Else (in other words, I’m not hungry), I won’t eat. Let’s take a look in python code!\nChallenge Let’s put it all together! Let’s see if we can create a program that takes prompts the user for their name. The user can write their name into the console. Then the computer can decide if their name is equal to your name, print out a response. Else, print out a different response!\n Hint: Try talking out the different paths to a computer can take! Make sure to identify what the if and else conditions are.\n"},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-earsketch/meet-dj-nuevo/","title":"Meet DJ Nuevo","tags":[],"description":"Set up headphones, check audio","content":"\nNuevo has new headphones!

Variables and Arrays In this game, we note that we will have to track the symbol currently in each of the 9 positions on the board.\nHence, we will need to store 9 pieces of data in the program. Let\u0026rsquo;s use an array(a data stucture) of size 9 to store these information.\nAs stated in the rules, on the game board, \u0026quot;X\u0026quot; is the player\u0026rsquo;s move, \u0026quot;O\u0026quot; is a computer move, and \u0026quot; \u0026quot; is an available spot.\nWith these information, let\u0026rsquo;s declare an array variable called board with the values of 9 \u0026quot; \u0026quot; String (i.e {\u0026quot; \u0026quot;, \u0026quot; \u0026quot;, \u0026quot; \u0026quot;, \u0026quot; \u0026quot;, \u0026quot; \u0026quot;, \u0026quot; \u0026quot;, \u0026quot; \u0026quot;, \u0026quot; \u0026quot;, \u0026quot; \u0026quot;}).\n4. Displaying the board Now we have the variable board storing current symbols on the game board, let\u0026rsquo;s try to print out an empty game board using print statements (shown below).\nNote that each game board consists of 5 lines, so it is reasonable to have 5 print statment to print out each board.\nEach of the 9 blocks is a String of length 3, where the middle character is the current symbol stored in board at the corresponding position.\nYou should have a program that has the output below after completing this step.\n\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;~ Tic Tac Toe ~\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; * Choose number 1 - 9 to place your move * Player: 'X' Computer: 'O' | | ---+---+--- | | ---+---+--- | | 5. Methods As we know we will need to print out the current game board several times throughout the game, so it will be a good idea to move the block of code you write in step 4 to a method.\nThis method should take an input of String[] and prints out the current board.

You do this by creating a class for each object you want on screen. Before objects are created in a program you must define their class. A class is what tells how an individual object will look and behave. It contains the attributes and methods that its object can use during the lifetime of a program (in this case it is Pong game). You only need to define a class once then you can use that class to create as many objects as you wish.\nYou cannot use a class directly in a program; a class must have an object as its manifestation that is used in program. All aspects related to visuals and movement are called the \u0026quot;attributes\u0026quot; of the object that you see on computer screen. All aspects related to control of an object are called \u0026quot;functions\u0026quot; of the object.\nFirst, define the class for paddle used in game. To do this, type in the following: class Paddle(pygame.Rect): def __init__(self, velocity, up_key, down_key, *args, **kwargs): self.velocity = velocity self.up_key = up_key self.down_key = down_key super().__init__(*args, **kwargs) def move_paddle(self, board_height): keys_pressed = pygame.key.get_pressed() if keys_pressed[self.up_key]: if self.y - self.velocity \u0026gt; 0: self.y -= self.velocity if keys_pressed[self.down_key]: if self.y + self.velocity \u0026lt; board_height - self.height: self.y += self.velocity Let\u0026rsquo;s try to understand the code in more detail.\nName the class class Paddle(pygame.Rect)\nThis is how you name the class \u0026quot;Paddle\u0026quot;. Now, notice the pygame.Rect inside (). You might have already imagined that in order to draw the paddle on a computer screen you need to draw it like a rectangle, then define its dimensions and position on screen to make it look like a paddle. The (pygame.Rect) statement allows us to tell the Python compiler to draw this object like a rectangle and provide all rectangle\u0026rsquo;s attributes to it like WIDTH and HEIGHT. This helps us make use of all attributes available to the Rectangle class in the Pygame library.\nAdd attributes def __init__(self, velocity, up_key, down_key, *args, **kwargs):\nDon\u0026rsquo;t worry about args and kwargs for now and focus on core attributes of Paddle class.\n__init__ function allows you to setup the class with attributes you need to see in objects. You can define additional attributes here on top of what you already get from Rectangle class. Let\u0026rsquo;s add attributes like velocity, up_key, down_key to represent the speed at which paddle can move, and the keys needed for upward and downward movement of the paddle.\nclass Paddle(pygame.Rect): def __init__(self, velocity, up_key, down_key, *args, **kwargs): self.velocity = velocity self.up_key = up_key self.down_key = down_key super().__init__(*args, **kwargs) Add methods move_paddle() is a method. We use this method to get paddle to perform move actions. In this case, move_paddle() moves the paddle upward or downward depending on the key we pressed, and at a certain speed.\ndef move_paddle(self, board_height): keys_pressed = pygame.key.get_pressed() if keys_pressed[self.up_key]: if self.y - self.velocity \u0026gt; 0: self.y -= self.velocity if keys_pressed[self.down_key]: if self.y + self.velocity \u0026lt; board_height - self.height: self.y += self.velocity \n Now that you have defined how a paddle should look and how it should move, feel free to take a look at classes for Ball and Pong.

We will add code to the below repl.it window, and we will do this in two parts.\n First, we need tell the turtle what color we want the line to be. To do this, let\u0026rsquo;s type in:\nturtle.color(\u0026quot;orange\u0026quot;) Let\u0026rsquo;s try to understand this line of code in more detail.\nStrings Anything you see in quotation marks is called a string. A string is just a sequence of characters (whether they are letters, numbers, or symbols).\nIn the code above, \u0026quot;orange\u0026quot; is a string. Other examples of strings include \u0026quot;123\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;abc!\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;green\u0026quot;. Be careful, 123, abc! and green are not strings because there are missing quotation marks!\nMethods turtle.color() is a method. We use methods to get the turtle to perform certain actions. In this case, turtle.color() is changing the color of the lines it draws to what color we tell it to. We told it to change the color to orange by sending it the string \u0026quot;orange\u0026quot; as an argument.\nArguments Arguments are inputs that you pass in to methods to use. In our example, turtle.color() needs a string argument representing the name of the color to set the turtle, so we passed in \u0026quot;orange\u0026quot; as an argument to the method. We could also have told it to change the color to something else, but it has to have been a color that turtle.color() understands. The colors that it recognizes are: \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;orange\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;yellow\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;green\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;purple\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pink\u0026quot;, and \u0026quot;gray\u0026quot;. If we send in anything else besides one of these color strings, we get the default color, which is black.\n Now that we have picked the color that we want, we can now draw a line! To draw a line there are two methods that we can use:\nturtle.forward(50) turtle.backward(50) turtle.forward(50) will make the turtle go forward 50 pixels and draw a line in the direction it\u0026rsquo;s facing, while turtle.backward(50) will do the same, but in the opposite direction.\nPixels An image is composed of thousands, if not, millions of pixels. A pixel is a unit of measurement for digital images, similar to how we measure weight in pounds, or long distances in miles.\nIntegers An integer is just any whole number, whether positive or negative. In this example, both turtle.forward() and turtle.backward() expect an integer as an argument instead of a string. This is because the argument represents the number of pixels you want the turtle to move when drawing. A string would clearly not work for these methods!\n Let\u0026rsquo;s make the turtle go forward, so type in turtle.forward(50). Now your code should look something like this:\nimport turtle turtle.color(\u0026quot;orange\u0026quot;) turtle.forward(50) Now that we have completed our code, press run. You should see the following in the result screen:\nIf so, great!

The actual story that the audience will be reading is string variables!\nLet’s mark it up on the story board! Here is what it looks like:\nIt’s really helpful to annotate your story board so you know what code related topics we can use! We see that the story line will be comprised off text or string variables. The user-input can be the reader typing whether they want to \u0026ldquo;walk\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;bike\u0026rdquo; or choose \u0026ldquo;soccer\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;swim\u0026rdquo;. The user can choose their story based off the input they give to the computer! The different paths that Nuvi can take are a series of decisions.

There are two types of basic loops in python: for loops and while loops.\nFor loops For loops iterate over a sequence. Let\u0026rsquo;s say you wanted to repeat a simple task 5 times. Here is how you would do it.\nThe following for loop iterates through each of the numbers in the list [1,2,3,4,5], and assigns the value x to it. Then, it executes the code within the for loop.\n What if you wanted to repeat a task 10 times instead? 100 times? 1000 times??\nIt would be difficult to write a list with 1000 numbers [1,2,3,4,5,6,\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;.,998,999,1000]. There is a function that can create this list for you.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example of how to create the list using the range function:\nThe below code creates a list starting at 1 and ending at 10. Try replacing the list [1,2,3,4,5] in the above example with this range function!\nrange(1,11) The list in the for loop doesn\u0026rsquo;t just have to be numbers, it can be anything! Here is another example of what you can do with it:\n While loops While loops are similar to for loops, but instead of iterating over a sequence, they repeat for as long as a certain condition is met. For example, let\u0026rsquo;s create a while loop that repeates 5 times.\n As you can see, all of the code below the while loop gets executed as long as the variable count is less than 5.\nBe careful! Make sure that the condition becomes False at some point, or the loop will continue infinitely.\nBreak statements You learned earlier that for loops and while loops keep iterating over a sequence until it reaches the end or until a condition is met.\nThere is another way to stop running these loops before the end of the list or before a condition is met.\nYou can do this with the break statement. This lets you break out of the loop in either a for loop or while loop.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example with a while loop:\n Challenges   Using a for loop or while loop, try printing the following pattern\n1 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5   Given a large list such as the one below, write a program that can find a particular number from this list.\n  For example, ask the user to enter a number in the console, then write to console if it was found.\n Question How would you change this program if the list is very large?

This is what you\u0026rsquo;ll be learning to use in this workshop.\nGo to game.js. Every Phaser game will start out off with a variable that stores the configurations for the game (often named config like we have here).\nvar config = { type: Phaser.AUTO, width: 512, height: 544, backgroundColor: 0x000000, scene: [Scene1, Scene2], physics: { default: \u0026#39;arcade\u0026#39;, arcade: { gravity: { y: 0 }, debug: false } }, }; In this variable, you\u0026rsquo;ll notice that we have defined a variety of characteristics of our game like the width, the height, and background color. We have also defined the scenes that we will be using (more info on scenes a bit later). You can also create a game without scenes and simply put all of the code into the game.js file.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll also notice that we define the physics of the game in Config as well. In game design, physics is one of the most essential aspects that define the \u0026ldquo;feel\u0026rdquo; of a game. For example, the bouncy physics in Mario distinctively makes it \u0026ldquo;feel like Mario.\u0026rdquo; For our game, you can see that we use \u0026ldquo;arcade\u0026rdquo; physics, a type of physics in Phaser that is very simple to use. Also notice that in our Physics, we define Gravity to be 0, because our game is a Space Shooter so we don\u0026rsquo;t need any gravity pulling our characters down.\nAt the end of game.js, you can see that we pass the config variable to a game variable, something that is also almost always needed in a Phaser game.\nPart 2: Scenes Now, let\u0026rsquo;s finally talk about scenes a little bit. A scene is essentially a game state that the user is operating within. It\u0026rsquo;s best understood within an example:\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take the famous game franchise, Pokemon. When you play, you\u0026rsquo;ll often be roaming around the world. When you encounter a trainer or a wild Pokemon in the tall grass, you enter a different scene so that you can battle. After you finish the battle, you may pull up your map to see where you need to go - this is also opening a different scene. These three scenes function completely different and have their own mechanics attached. When you log out of the map, the game switches scenes to the world where you roam as the player. And once you get into battle, you switch to the battle scene. You can see how creating these three game states would be completely different - the battle requires a menu, the world requires a 2D space and a player, and the map is essentially an interactable chart. We separate these into scenes because they all have to be created completely differently.\nYou can think of the user as moving amongst scenes as they play the game. They only use one scene at a time, and each one is almost like it\u0026rsquo;s own mini-game (although there will usually be one main one that isn\u0026rsquo;t quite \u0026ldquo;mini\u0026rdquo;).\nTechnically\u0026hellip; Technically, we could use a single scene for all three of these game states if we wanted to (how you divide a game into scenes will be up to the game designer). It is physically possible to do so. However, creating separate scenes will make the coding significantly easier (in this case, I can\u0026rsquo;t even imagine how you could cram them into one without simply placing the visuals of one on top of another).\n Here is another example of a very common way to use scenes: a title screen.\nThe first scene displays simply a title screen that often contains things like settings, loading a save file, and more. Once the player clicks play, they are switched to a different scene, where they\u0026rsquo;ll play the game within.\nThis is exactly what we\u0026rsquo;re going to be doing. Scene 1 will contain a title screen, and Scene 2 will contain our actual gameplay. Thus, Scene 2 will have the majority of the code, and it\u0026rsquo;ll be where you will do most if your work.\nPart 3: Infinite Canvas When you start up the game on the repl, you can see a blank canvas on your screen where you will eventually place things onto. However, you are only seeing a part of the total canvas - actually, the canvas is infinite in all directions. The canvas behaves the same way in all sections - this means that objects can move and be placed into parts of the canvas that the user cannot see. This will become important because for our game, we don\u0026rsquo;t want things really going out of the screen very much, so we need to bind our objects within the screen or delete them if they exit.\n"},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/guidelines/site-architecture/","title":"How the site is built","tags":[],"description":"","content":"How the site is built The workshops subdomain content is built using the DocDock theme for Hugo.

Obtaining User Input In the previous activity, we prompt the user to enter numbers from 1 - 9. Hence, we will be expecting an int from the input stream.\nTo obtain the int the Scanner object stores, we call the method nextInt() on sc, the Scanner object.\npublic int nextInt(); 4. Test Your Program (optional) To test your program, add a print statement to prints out the value you store from nextInt().\nTry to run your program, and type in some numbers and click enter. You should see your number being correctly printed out. For example:\n\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;~ Tic Tac Toe ~\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; * Choose number 1 - 9 to place your move * Player: 'X' Computer: 'O' 1 | 2 | 3 ---+---+--- 4 | 5 | 6 ---+---+--- 7 | 8 | 9 Enter your move (1-9): 2 \u0026lt;------- the number you typed in Input Number: 2 \u0026lt;------- Print statement printed the inputted number correctly What happens when user type something that\u0026rsquo;s not a number? When writing programs, we can never expect user to type in the correct values even when it\u0026rsquo;s spelled out in the prompt.\nSo, since our program only expects an int input.\nThe program will crash when you type in anything that\u0026rsquo;s not a number, such as: hi, $, 20.1. You will see an error message like the following:\nException in thread \u0026quot;main\u0026quot; java.util.InputMismatchException \u0026lt;------ tells you what error it is at java.base/java.util.Scanner.throwFor(Scanner.java:939) at java.base/java.util.Scanner.next(Scanner.java:1594) at java.base/java.util.Scanner.nextInt(Scanner.java:2258) at java.base/java.util.Scanner.nextInt(Scanner.java:2212) at Main.main(Main.java:15) \u0026lt;------ tells you which line of code causes the error (line 15 in Main.java) Also, note that number inputs that are not in the range 1 - 9 wouldn\u0026rsquo;t crash the program, but these are also inputs we don\u0026rsquo;t want.\n 5. Handling Invalid Inputs with Scanner The Scanner class provides methods which check for valid or invalid inputs. For example, the method\npublic boolean hasNextInt(); will check if the value of the user\u0026rsquo;s input is an integer and returns true or false. This method can be used to ensure that the user\u0026rsquo;s input is valid.\n8. Test Your Program (optional) Test your program by clicking Run, you should see the message Invalid Position; re-enter your move (1-9): if you entered a non-number input, or a number that isn\u0026rsquo;t between 1 through 9.\n9. Taking Multiple Inputs Now we have a program that takes in one input and evaluates if it\u0026rsquo;s valid, we want to ask the player to do it again until the game ends.\nTo continue prompting the user to enter his/her next move, we put the whole hasNextInt if statement in a while loop. This while loop takes in an argument of true meaning the program will continuing looping until instructed to stop.\nNote that we call printBoard(board) and prompt the user at the end of each iteration, shown below:\nwhile(true){ // insert the hasNextInt() if statement here  // move these into the hasNextInt() if statement  printBoard(board); System.out.print(\u0026#34;Enter your move (1-9): \u0026#34;); } 10. Handling Invalid Input When a user enters an invalid input, we do not what the program to call printBoard(board) and print Enter your move (1-9): .\nIn other words, we want to program to continue on to the next iteration of in the while loop.\nWe put continue; in the code to indicate the computer to skip back and execute from to the top of the while loop again.\nBy the end of this exercise, you should have a program that prompts you to re-enter for any invalid inputs, and prints out an empty board with the prompt Enter your move (1-9):  for any valid inputs!\n\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;~ Tic Tac Toe ~\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; * Choose number 1 - 9 to place your move * Player: 'X' Computer: 'O' 1 | 2 | 3 ---+---+--- 4 | 5 | 6 ---+---+--- 7 | 8 | 9 Enter your move (1-9): 1 | | ---+---+--- | | \u0026lt;--------------- The board doesn't have the player/computer moves ---+---+--- | | Enter your move (1-9): d Invalid Input; re-enter your move (1-9): 3 | | ---+---+--- | | \u0026lt;--------------- The board doesn't have the player/computer moves ---+---+--- | | Enter your move (1-9): Let\u0026rsquo;s continue on the workshop to see how we should update our game board!\n"},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/java-basics/activity-2/","title":"Variables and Types","tags":[],"description":"Introduce types and variables in Java.","content":" 1. Variables: Name It! In the last exercise, we learn to print different statements with System.out.print().\nWhile it\u0026rsquo;s great to print out a number or a sentence, we haven\u0026rsquo;t given them a meaning.\nIn Java, we introduce the idea of a variable for data. A variable is like a box that stores a piece of data with a name.\nFor example, there can be a variable called myName that stored \u0026quot;Patrick\u0026quot;, another variable called loveMusic that stored true, and another variable called age that stored 3. Just like the image below:\n2. What the Type! So how do we create these boxes or variables in Java to store data?\nBefore learning that we need to learn the concept of type in Java. Each variable has its own type that restrict it to store a specific kind of data.\nFor example, the variable called age that store the number 3 should contain contain integers, not sentences or symbols.\nIn Java, for a variable to store whole numbers, it is type int. And, we declare a int variable called age with data 3 with the line of code:\nint age = 3; In general, to declare a variable we write them in the format: [data type] [variable name] = [data];.\nThe following are the important data types that have been built-in in Java:\n  int type: an integer (i.e. 20, 30, 35).\n  char type: a character such as a symbol or single alphabet letter (i.e. 'A', 'b', '(', ']').\n  String type: a sequence of char (i.e. \u0026quot;Hello\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Bonjour\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Hola\u0026quot;).\n  boolean type: a type that is either the value true or false.\n  double type: type that store fractional numbers (i.e. 2.0, 3.14, 9.33).\n   Let\u0026rsquo;s revisit the three variables we talked about and identify their data types.\nTo declare these variables in Java, we type the following:\nString name = \u0026#34;Patrick\u0026#34;; int age = 10; boolean loveMusic = true; 3. What the Type \u0026ndash; Help Patrick! Patrick 🐥 isn\u0026rsquo;t a master of data types! He often mixed them up when declaring variables. Let\u0026rsquo;s help him fix his mistake:\n By storing data in variables, you can use that data later or change it by assigning it to a different data of the same type. For example:\nint age = 10; System.out.println(age); // prints out 10 age = 11; // assign data 11 to the variable age System.out.println(age); // prints out 11 \n 4. What the Type \u0026ndash; Track Numbers! Now consider the following code. What do you think the output is? Track the values of each variable by yourself then test it out below!\ndouble x = 2.3; double y = 10.0; int z = 4; x = y; y = x; z = 0; z = z; System.out.println(\u0026#34;x: \u0026#34; + x + \u0026#34; y: \u0026#34; + y + \u0026#34; z: \u0026#34; + z ); "},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-basics/data-types/booleans/","title":"Booleans","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Booleans are True or False statements. Unlike strings or numbers, booleans store statements of truth: is what I\u0026rsquo;m saying true or false?\nFor example, if I say, \u0026ldquo;You are a robot\u0026rdquo;, a boolean can store whether this statement is true. In this case, since you are not a robot (hopefully!), False would be stored.\nWhat are the boolean answers to these questions about you?\n I am a human. _______ I have 25 fingers. _______ I like cookies. _______ My favorite color is blue. ______     Operator Description Operator Description     \u0026lt; Less than \u0026gt; Greater than   \u0026lt;= Less than or equal to \u0026gt;= Greater than or equal to   == Equal to != Not equal to    Challenge 1 As usual, use print to print out your results to the following:\nprint(5 + 8 \u0026lt; 10) print((3 + 5) * 6) == (65 - 17) The first statement should return False. And the second should return True.\nChallenge 2 Try printing out the answers to the following expressions using print.

Here are some more examples:\n (5 \u0026lt; 8) and (9 != 10) produces True since both 5 is less than 8 and 9 is not equal to 10. (8 \u0026lt;= 2) or (\u0026ldquo;h\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;e\u0026rdquo; == \u0026ldquo;he\u0026rdquo;) produces True since \u0026ldquo;h\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;e\u0026rdquo; results in \u0026ldquo;he\u0026rdquo;, even though 8 is not less than or equal to 2. (6 != 2 * 3) or (8 \u0026lt; 2 * 4) produces False since both 6 not equal to 2 * 3, and 8 being less than 2 * 4, produce False.  What do you think the following expressions produce?

Actually, computers have RGB mode to represent colors.\nRGB format In Python, we follow a specific format when defining colors: (R, G, B), where \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;G\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo; are all integers. \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo; represents some amount of red, \u0026ldquo;G\u0026rdquo; represents some amount of green, and \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo; represents some amount of blue.\nThe color represented by (R, G, B) is what we get from \u0026ldquo;the mix of\u0026rdquo; different amounts of red, green and blue.\nYou can click the line below and choose the colors you want on the color board to observe their RGB values: What do we mean by the \u0026ldquo;mix of colors\u0026rdquo;?\nHere we are using different amounts of red, green and blue light to get a new color of light. Just like we use different amounts of pigments while painting, we are mixing different amounts of lights to create different colors of light. Pigments use the primary colors of red, yellow and blue, whereas computers use primary colors of red, green and blue light.\nThis picture represents very approximately how colors mix up: Just as we should not use too much pigments, there is also limitation for represent colors. The maximum integer we can use to represent each amount of color is 255 and the minimum integer we can use to represent each amount of color is 0. This is defined in RGB mode.\nIn all the following materials, \u0026ldquo;color\u0026rdquo; means \u0026ldquo;the color of the light\u0026rdquo;.\n Q\u0026amp;A  Which color does (0, 0, 0) represent?

Components that are plugged into the same common connection are connected in the circuit  The Light Emitting Diode (or LED for short) is a small light that turns on when electricity flows through it.\n The LED has 2 leads: the Anode and the Cathode. The Anode is longer than the Cathode and is always attached to the higher voltage.   The resistor is a small piece of ceramic material that slows down the flow of electricity.\n A resistor has 2 leads, but it is omnidirectional. In other words, it doesn’t matter which lead you attach to the higher voltage. Most electronics can only handle a certain amount of electricity before they break, so resistors protect the other components in our game by keeping the electricity low.

Your screen should look like this:\nDefining the Variables Today we are going to be using oranges to tell our Adafruit when to make noise. The first thing we need to do is give the computer a name for each orange and where to look for what they are saying. We do the first part by defining a variable. Click on the section that says VARIABLES, it is salmon colored and 7th from the top. Then define a variable by clicking on Make a Variable and giving it a name. Do this twice, here we define ours as analog1 and analog2 but you can call them whatever you want.\nInterpreting out Inputs Now that we have a name that our computer knows for our oranges, we must let our Adafruit know how to understand them. There are two kinds of inputs, digital and analog. Light switches and power buttons are examples of digital inputs. They are either on or off, 1’s or 0’s. Analog inputs are like a light dimmer or a volume button. They have more options for values. Our oranges are going to be analog inputs and how much we are touching or squeezing them will change the value they report to the Adafruit.\nClick again on the Variables section. This time you should see a few more options now that we’ve defined our two variables. Drag one of the “set ___ to __” blocks into the green “forever” block in our workspace. Using the white down arrow, change the first blank to “analog1”.\nNext, click on the down arrow by ADVANCED then click on PINS. Look for the “analog read pin __” block, it will be third from the top, and insert it where the 0 is on our “set analog1 to 0” block is. To insert it into that slot, drag it so that it’s hovering over the zero, check that the 0 is highlighted in yellow, then let go of the mouse (or touchpad). You should see the block extend to accommodate the block. If you don’t see this, try again.\nOnce you’ve done that, your workspace should look like the above picture. Repeat this process again but this time use the white down arrows to select analog2 and A2. See below to verify you’ve done this correctly. Creating our Loops Now that our computer knows what to call our oranges, and how to understand what they are saying, let’s create a loop that will check for when we are holding our orange. Click on the LOGIC section and drag the “If ____ then” block out to put it under your variable blocks.\nLet’s go back to the volume knob example to understand the comparison we are going to be making in our loop. Every person has a sweet spot for how loud they like to listen to their music to be able to enjoy it the most. This sweet spot is also true for our oranges. They’ll tell the computer a number when they’re just sitting there and a lower number when we touch them. The trick is to find the spot in between so that we only make noise when we want to.\nTo set this up, go to the LOGIC section again and grab the hexagonal “ __ \u0026lt; __ “ block that’s second under the Comparison subsection. Place that on top of the “true” in the “if __ then” block. Make sure you see the yellow highlight before dropping it there. Check the picture below to verify your workspace.\nNow let’s put in what we are comparing. Go back to the VARIABLES section, pull out analog1, and put it in the first slot. Then click on the second slot and type 40. This 40 should be a good sweet spot for most people. If at the end, your orange is making noise without you touching it, you can come back to this step and make the number bigger. If your orange isn’t making noise when you touch it, you can come back and make the number bigger. For now, let’s just leave it at 40.\nNow we can pick out our music! Click on the MUSIC section and drag the second block ”play _____ until done” into our If-Then block. Feel free to click on that down arrow and select your own sounds.\nNow we want to repeat these last few steps for analog2. Once you do this, your workspace will look like the picture below (but with your music options).\nAdded Fun With Lights (Time Permitting) The Adafruit chip has a lot of lights on it! They’re super fun to play with so let’s add a bit of color to our sounds so we can both see and hear the difference when we touch our oranges. Click on the LIGHT section and drag the “Set all Pixels to ___” block into our two If-Then chunks. You’ll want to drop them in right before we play a sound. You can click on the color portion to change which color you want to display.\n"},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-basics/data-structures/","title":"Data Structures","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Topics  Lists \n   Tuples \n   Sets \n    "},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-earsketch/python-basics/","title":"Python Basics","tags":[],"description":"basics of python","content":"Python basics To code music, we need to learn a little Python.

If you scroll through, you will see that each scene has a constructor (because it is a class), and also three large methods: preload(), create(), update(). There are also a number of helper functions in Scene 2, but we will talk about the aforementioned three methods because they are integral to understanding Phaser.\nWith the way we\u0026rsquo;ve set up the scenes, preload() and create() are in Scene 1 and create() and update() are in Scene 2. These three functions are the main tools that any game using Phaser will utilize.\nPreload() Let\u0026rsquo;s start by describing preload() - this function essentially loads things into our game. This can be images, variables, and pretty much anything else that you want to define for your game to use. Things loaded up into the game with preload() are NOT actually used or put anywhere in the game until you use it later. You can think of this method like a storage space that is filled once before the game starts. Most things have to be put into preload() before they are used anywhere in the game.\nCreate() Next is create(). This function is also relatively straightforward - it runs once at the beginning of the game and allows the user to place the things that they\u0026rsquo;ve preloaded with preload() and create objects within our game such as animations, collision detectors, text, groups, and much more.\nUpdate() Finally, the last function is update(). While preload() and create() run only once at the start of the game, update() runs constantly.\nWhile playing games, you may have encountered the term \u0026ldquo;FPS\u0026rdquo;. This refers to the \u0026ldquo;frames per second\u0026rdquo; of the game, or how often a new frame is updated on the screen. A frame is essentially a single call to the update() method. Phaser typically runs at 60 FPS, meaning the update() method is called 60 times in a single second!\n The update() method is used in a variety of ways. One is for movement - if we assign an object to move a little bit in update(), then when we play the game, it will look like the object is moving smoothly because update() is being called so often that we can\u0026rsquo;t see the breaks in between each movement. We can also use update() to constantly check whether an input has given. For example, if we want the player to be able to shoot when the spacebar is pressed, we can use an if-statement that checks for the spacebar in the update() function, so that the game is constantly checking for this.\n"},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/javascript-basics/arrays/properties/","title":"Properties","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Array properties or characteristics are a way to describe the attributes of the array.

Setting Up Computer Moves Create a new method getComputerMove(String[] curBoard) that produce a valid move for the computer (between 1 to 9) with an input of the current game board.\nFollow next step to implement the method.\n 3. Implementing the Computer\u0026rsquo;s Movement In getComputerMove(), we will randomly generate a number between 1 and 9 for the computer.\nWe will do so with the help of the class Random which is often used in Java to generate random numbers.\nTo use this class and all its methods, we need to import the class with the following line of code on the top of the file.\nimport java.util.Random; Create a Random object by calling the constructor Random().\n 4. Generating Random Numbers Call the method int nextInt(int num) on the Random object you created to generate a number from 1 to 9 randomly.\nA method call to int nextInt(int num) will return a random number from 0 to num-1.\n 5. Checking for Valid Mood After having a random number from 1 to 9, we need to check if the spot is available.\nUse a while loop to generate a valid move for the computer, if the previously randomly generate number is not an available spot!\nReturn the number once we find a valid move for the computer.\n 6.

When variableA is in rangeA, we will go to the inner for loop. If variableB is in rangeB, statement(B) will be executed. If variableB is not in rangeB, we will skip the inner for loop and and go to the outer loop.  In conclusion, if variableA is not in rangeA, none of the statements will be executed; statement(B) and statement(A) will both be executed if and only if variableA is in rangeA and variableB is in rangeB.\n#This is the example for nested for loop #Below is our outer loop for n in range(0, 3): #Below is our inner loop for m in range(0, 3): #Print if m is in range(0, 3) print(\u0026#34;(\u0026#34;, n, \u0026#34;,\u0026#34;, m, \u0026#34;)\u0026#34;, end = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;) #Print if n is in range(0, 3) print(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) This is the output of our example. Questions Can you try to explain the printing pattern?

Let\u0026rsquo;s do Math: Arithmetic Operator In the last exercise, we learn about variables any how we can assign values to a variable of a specific type, such as:\nint age = 3; // declare variable age of type int with value 3 age = 4; // assign 4 to the variable age Looking at the code above, it essentially add 1 to the value of the variable age.\nAnd, in Java, we can perform math operations on variables directly with arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %. For example, we can use the add operator + to add 1 to age:\nint age = 3; // declare variable age of type int with value 3 age = age + 1;// add 1 to age The following are the arithmetic operators in Java:\n  +: addition.\n  -: subtraction.\n  *: multiplication.\n  /: (regular real) division. Note: 10 / 4 returns 2, not 2.5 since we throw away the remainder.\n  %: mod/remainder. Note: 10 / 4 returns 2. This operation get the remainder of the division.\n   Add (+) is used on String as concatenation operator. For example:\nString name = \u0026quot;Patric\u0026quot; + \u0026quot;k\u0026quot;; is same as String name = \u0026quot;Patrick\u0026quot;;\n 2. Comparisons: Relational Operator Next, let\u0026rsquo;s learn how to compare numbers. Let me introduce the relational operators.\nJust like in math, we can compare numbers using \u0026gt;, \u0026lt;, \u0026gt;=, \u0026lt;=. For example: (3 \u0026gt; 2) is true, a boolean value.\nThe following are the relational operators in Java:\n  ==: equal to. (i.e. (3 == 3) is true)\n  !=: not equal to. (i.e. (3 != 3) is false)\n  \u0026gt;: greater than.\n  \u0026lt;: less than.\n  \u0026gt;=: greater than or equal to.\n  \u0026lt;=: less than or equal to.\n  Note: you can use == and != on 2 pieces of data of the same type.\n 3.

Note that there are 10 variables in total, and average has been declared for you).\nHint: for example, the variable patrickGrade should be declared and assigned on line 13 as int patrickGrade = 88;.\n  Calculate the correct class average and assign it to variable average using arithmetic operators such as +, -, *, /, %.\nNote that an average score is (total points)/(number of students).\n  Assign variables over60, over70, over80, over90 with the correct value using relational operators such as \u0026gt;, \u0026lt;, \u0026gt;=, \u0026lt;=.\n  Run the program and see the report printed!\n    "},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-basics/data-types/","title":"Data Types","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Topics  Strings \n   Numbers \n   Booleans \n    "},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/jsappybird/load-the-bird/","title":"Load the bird image","tags":[],"description":"","content":"First of all let\u0026rsquo;s load Flappy and put it on the screen.\nAdd below command in the file [File: load-sprites.js] game.load.image(\u0026lsquo;bird\u0026rsquo;,\u0026lsquo;assets/bird.png\u0026rsquo;);\nWorking Together In the repl.it window below, we started the code with the line game.load.image('bird', 'assets/bird.png');.\nIn your console you should see a Jsappy bird after you press run:\n"},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-basics/basics/variables/","title":"Variables","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Variables are simply names that we can give to values such as strings, numbers, and booleans.

Wouldn’t it be great if we can give instructions once and tell the program to repeat it 4 times? Fear not, we can!\nTo do this, we need to use loops. Loops run a set of instructions multiple times. To see this in action, here is some example code that draws a triangle:\nfor i in range(3): turtle.forward(50) turtle.left(120) Let’s understand what this code does. for i in range(3): This statement tells the program to run the instructions in a loop. range(3) sets a limit to how many times the loop runs (in this case, 3 times). The letter i is called a variable. It is used to keep track of how many times we have run the contents of the loop.\nTricky Python syntax - Part 1 Syntax is how we write languages so that it is understandable. In English we have spelling and grammar rules to help understand each other.

Now, we only repeat turtle.forward(50) three times, and we get a straight line instead!\nfor i in range(3): turtle.forward(50) turtle.left(120) \n Now, take the example code that we have provided, and modify it slightly so that, instead of drawing a triangle, it draws a square.

If you do not initialize color value, the image is filled with black.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see some examples # Remember to import Image from PIL import Image img = Image.new(\u0026#39;RGB\u0026#39;, (200,100),(100,100,100)) img.save(\u0026#39;pil_grey.png\u0026#39;) The variable img stores the PNG image that looks like this:\n# Remember to import Image from PIL import Image img=Image.new(\u0026#39;RGB\u0026#39;, (200,100),\u0026#34;black\u0026#34;) img.save(\u0026#39;pil_black.png\u0026#39;) Here, specifying black as the RGB color creates and stores the PNG image that looks like this:\nChanging a pixel in an image What if we want to put another pixel in an image?\nThe function img.putpixel( (x,y), (r, g, b)) puts a new pixel on the image with the given position and color. Position is a (width, height) value of that pixel\u0026rsquo;s location on the image. Color is the RGB Color of that pixel.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see an example # Remember to import Image from PIL import Image img=Image.new(\u0026#39;RGB\u0026#39;, (200,100),\u0026#34;yellow\u0026#34;) img.putpixel( (100,50), (0, 0, 0)) img.save(\u0026#39;pil_black-dot.png\u0026#39;) After creating a 200x100 yellow image, the putpixel function puts a tiny small dot in the middle of this yellow block. This is one small pixel - in fact, it\u0026rsquo;s so small you may have to expand the image to actually see it!\n"},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/security/spy-game/","title":"Spy Game","tags":[],"description":"","content":"From our last activity we learnt that a strong password is a combination of random characters (possibly having uppercase and lowercase letters), numbers and some special characters.

This process of heading down the filesystem tree, branching at a new directory can go on for many more steps in some cases.

Now, let us create our grey filter together.\nExample - Create a grey filter Let us change the original cat image below with our grey filter together!\n# We need to import PIL package to allow manipulation with pixels. from PIL import Image # Open the cat image img = Image.open(\u0026#34;cat.png\u0026#34;) # Grey filters for i in range(img.size[0]): # For every col: for j in range(img.size[1]): # For every row color = img.getpixel( (i,j)) # Get color  GREY = (color[0] + color[1] + color[2]) // 3 # Average the pixel values img.putpixel((i,j),(GREY, GREY, GREY)) # Set the color accordingly # Save the cat after filtering img.save(\u0026#34;Mycat.png\u0026#34;) Remember, to set a grey pixel all three values of RGB have to be the same. However, setting each pixel to the same random value (ex. 200) will make the whole image grey, rather than just adding a filter on top of the existing cat image.\nHow can we best figure out how to set a pixel to be the \u0026lsquo;greyed\u0026rsquo; version of it? We can take an average of each value of the RGB colors. You can use // to do an integer division, which guarantees that the result of the average operation is a whole number.\n Wow! This is our cat after the grey filter.\nExample - Partial filter Now, let us think about how to add filter on only part of our lovely cat.\n# We need to import PIL package to allow manipulation with pixels. from PIL import Image # Open the cat image img = Image.open(\u0026#34;cat.png\u0026#34;) # Grey filters for i in range((img.size[0] // 2)): # For first-half columns for j in range((img.size[1] // 2)): # For first-half rows color = img.getpixel((i,j)) # Get color GREY = (color[0] + color[1] + color[2]) // 3 # Average the pixel values img.putpixel((i,j),(GREY, GREY, GREY)) # Set the colour accordingly #Save the cat after filtering img.save(\u0026#34;Mycat.png\u0026#34;) Wow! This is our cat after the filter.

Let\u0026rsquo;s do this by using the Pillow ImageFilter function filter() \u0026amp; convert().\nTo use the filter() function, you can specify the ImageFilter type within the parentheses. For example, image.filter(ImageFilter.BLUR) will make the image blurry. Or, if you use ImageFilter.CONTOUR instead, it will add a ‘sketch’ type effect to your image.\nFor example, for the \u0026lsquo;img\u0026rsquo; above:\nblurredImage = img.filter(ImageFilter.BLUR) blurredImage.save(\u0026#34;myCatBlurred.jpg\u0026#34;) You should see the saved cat image is blurred. Try this with a few other image filters until you find one you like!\nAdditionally, we can use the convert() function to set our image to black \u0026amp; white. To use this function, you can specify the mode you want to convert your image to. The most common ones are \u0026ldquo;L\u0026rdquo;, which converts an image to greyscale, and “RGB” which converts an image to its true color.\nLet’s try it out like this:\ngreyscaleImage = img.convert(\u0026#34;L\u0026#34;) greyscaleImage.save(\u0026#34;myCatBW.jpg\u0026#34;) If you combine the blurred function and the black and white convert function, you\u0026rsquo;ll get something like this – purrfect!\n  "},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/phaser-space-invaders-game/placing-things/","title":"Placing Things into Phaser","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Placing Text Now, you will learn how to place things within Phaser. Look at the repl below.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s first go over how to place text!\nmessage = this.add.text(20, 10, \u0026#34;Hello World!\u0026#34;, { font: \u0026#34;25px Arial\u0026#34;, fill: \u0026#34;white\u0026#34; }); These lines of code create a variable named \u0026ldquo;message.\u0026rdquo; This variable adds the text \u0026ldquo;Hello World\u0026rdquo; to the (X, Y) coordinate (20, 10) on our game window. The code also specifices that the text is created to be the color white, have font Arial, and have font size 25 px.\nPut this line in your create() method at the bottom of the page and see if it pops up in your game window.\n When creating text, the variable name is not the text that gets displayed the screen, it is what you put in quotations This syntax can also be used to place text that is stored in a String variable. \n Help! My game window is very small! Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, it\u0026rsquo;s actually relatively big, but repl minimizes it as default. You can extend your window view by dragging around the bars in between them.\n Placing a Background Texts are very simple, but when we want to use our own custom sprites for the game (which you almost always will), you have to first load the sprite in preload() before you specify its location in create().\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start by creating a background. Put this code into your preload() method.\nthis.load.image(\u0026#39;background\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;assets/sky.png\u0026#39;); This simply loads the image into the game. Next, let\u0026rsquo;s add this image to the game with create():\nthis.add.image(400, 300, \u0026#39;sky\u0026#39;); This line simply places the image on coordinate (400, 300). Try it out, and see if your background is no longer a black screen!\nThe coordinate (400, 300) refers to the location where we are placing the center pixel of our image. This means that (400, 300) will be the center of the image. We are placing the image here so that it covers the whole screen like a background should.\n Placing a Character Next, let\u0026rsquo;s put a character into our world.\nThe code that goes into your preload() function looks like this:\nthis.load.spritesheet(\u0026#39;dude\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;assets/dude.png\u0026#39;, { frameWidth: 32, frameHeight: 48 }); This requires a bit more code because it is a spritesheet instead of a simple sprite. Spritesheets look like this: This is the spritesheet for our character. Spritesheets are essentially a collection of sprites of a single character or thing in multiple positions. When played back to back, they will create animation for our game (which we will describe in more detail in the next lesson). Although it is obvious to us that it is a bunch of images of the same character, the computer isn\u0026rsquo;t able to easily detect this on its own. So we have to have more syntax to tell the computer how big each character sprite is in the spritesheet (in this case, 32x48).\nThe syntax to place this spritesheet in create() is nearly the same as with the image, but with a physics tag:\ndude = this.physics.add.sprite(250, 200, \u0026#39;dude\u0026#39;); In this line, we are creating variable \u0026ldquo;player\u0026rdquo; that adds the first image in the spritesheet at coordinate (250, 200). The image is also given the name \u0026ldquo;dude.\u0026rdquo;\nIn this line, player is the name of a variable that we are creating. 250 and 200 are the X and Y coordinates that we have placed the sprite, so it will be placed at the coordinate (250, 200) on our screen. \u0026ldquo;dude\u0026rdquo; is the name of our sprite, but it won\u0026rsquo;t come into play in this particular lesson.\nTry adding in the character! Do you see the character on your screen?\n In order to see the character, the dude variable in create() MUST be created after the background. This is because code is read by the computer from top to bottom, so if the character is placed before the background, then the computer will put the background on top of the character, covering him and making him not visible by the user. The dude is supposed to be looking to the left because at first placement, spritesheets will always be placed in the first entry in the sheet, and for our dude, he\u0026rsquo;s looking to the left \n  "},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/guidelines/formatting/","title":"Formatting","tags":[],"description":"","content":"When creating or modifying workshops, you\u0026rsquo;ll write them using standard Markdown syntax, plus some additional custom syntax.

Please refer to these activity to review or learn the concepts before continuing!\n 1. Displaying a Winner Write a method getWinner(String[] curBoard) that returns the winner in a String with an array input of the current game board.\n If the player wins, return \u0026quot;Congratulations! \\nYou won the Game :)\u0026quot;. If the computer wins, return \u0026quot;Game Over! \\nYou lost the Game :(\u0026quot;. If there\u0026rsquo;s a tie, return \u0026quot;It's a TIE! Try again\u0026quot;. If there isn\u0026rsquo;t a winner yet, return \u0026quot;\u0026quot;.  There are several ways to write this method.\nGive it a try in the following repl.it first; it will tell you if your method is correctly written!\n Ideas/Hints for writing the method getWinner()  Concatenate Strings at the 3 positions that consist a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. Use equals() to check if each of the concatenated Strings is \u0026quot;XXX\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;OOO\u0026quot; for a winner. (You can even create another method that checks if an input String is \u0026quot;XXX\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;OOO\u0026quot;) If all the spots in the array is filled (a for loop can be helpful) and there is no winner, the game ends in a tie. \n 2. Calling the Winner Method In main(), call the method getWinner() after the line of code where you place the player\u0026rsquo;s move, \u0026quot;X\u0026quot;.\nCheck if the game should continue (when there is no winner or a tie).\nIf there is a winner or a tie, print out the final board and the game result! And, add the line of code break;, which prompts the program to break out from the while loop!\n 3. Repeat Step Two In main(), repeat the code in step 2 (check winner and print result if needed) after you place the computer\u0026rsquo;s move, \u0026quot;O\u0026quot;.\n 4. Close the Scanner Object Outside of the while loop, add the code sc.close() to close the Scanner object from reading any new inputs.\nIt is good practice to close the Scanner object if we won\u0026rsquo;t be getting any more inputs after we break from the while loop!\n 5. All Done :) ! You should now have a functioning TicTacToe game! I am so proud of you to finish this workshop!

Make a Decision: If-Statement Patrick 🐥 is a very polite duck who likes to greet everyone he meets with \u0026ldquo;Good Morning,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Good Afternoon,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Good Night\u0026rdquo; depends on the current time.\n(image by National Geographic: giphy.com/natgeochannel)\nAs we learned before, we can print these statements as below:\nSystem.out.println(\u0026#34;Good Morning\u0026#34;); // say it between 0:00 - 11:59 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Good Afternoon\u0026#34;); // say it between 12:00 - 19:59 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Good Night\u0026#34;); // say it between 20:00 - 23:59 However, we also know Patrick 🐥 should only decide to say one of these statements depends on the time.\nIn other words, we need to write code that makes a decision on what to print depend on a situation.\nIn Java, we make a decision by using if statement or if\u0026hellip;else statement. Read the notes below:\nIf Statement if(boolean expression){ statement(s) } An if statement follows the structure shown above. The statement in the block will only be executed if the boolean expression is true. Otherwise, the program will skip to the statement after the block.\nIf-Else Statement if(boolean expression){ statement(s) A }else{ statement(s) B } An if-else statement follows the structure shown above. If the boolean expression is true, the program will execute the if-block with statement(s) A. Otherwise, the program executes only the else-block with statement(s) B.\nExample boolean likeMusic = true; if(likeMusic == true){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;I like Music\u0026#34;); }else{ System.out.println(\u0026#34;I don\u0026#39;t like Music\u0026#34;); } The code above will print the statement I like Music because the boolean expression, likeMusic == true, is true.\n Let\u0026rsquo;s revisit the greating example above, and make decision for Patrick on whether to say \u0026ldquo;Good Morning,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Good Afternoon,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Good Night\u0026rdquo;.\nPatrick should say \u0026ldquo;Good Morning\u0026rdquo; between 0:00 - 11:59, \u0026ldquo;Good Afternoon\u0026rdquo; between 12:00 - 19:59, and \u0026ldquo;Good Night\u0026rdquo; between 20:00 - 23:59.\n We have a variable currentHour that stores the current hour. Fill out the correct boolean expression A and boolean expression B to complete the program. Test your result by assigning the variable currentHour to numbers from 0 to 23:   2. Repeat It Again: For-Loop, While-Loop In math class, Patrick\u0026rsquo;s 🐥 teacher ask the class to solve a math challenge, and he might need some help.\nThe teacher asks them to find the sum of 1, 2, 3, \u0026hellip;., 100. That is what is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 \u0026hellip; + 99 + 100?\nWhile we can plug this in to a calculator, that is gonna take a while. Thankfully, in Java, you can easily calculate this in 3 lines with the help of a for loop or while loop.\nFor loop and While loop are control structures in Java that allow you to execute blocks of code multiples times.\nWhile Loop while(boolean expression){ statement(s) } statement(s) in the while block will be executed as long as the boolean expression is true.\nThe following is an example that prints out 1 through 10:\nint number = 1; while(number \u0026lt;= 10){ System.out.println(number); number = number + 1; // number is incremented by 1 } In the while loop above, the program will print out the value of number and increment number. This step will be performed as long as number \u0026lt;= 10, and in this case the loop terminates when number is 11.\nFor Loop for(initialization; termination condition; update statement){ statement(s) } In a for loop, there are three parts the in condition block: initialization, termination condition, and update statement.\n When executing a for loop, the program will execute the initialization part. An example is, int number = 1. Next, the program checks for termination condition. An example is number \u0026lt;= 10. If it is true, execute the statement(s) and the update statement (an example is number = number + 1) then repeat step 2. If it is false, exit the for loop.  The following is an example that prints out 1 through 10:\nfor(int number = 1; number \u0026lt;= 10; number = number + 1){ System.out.println(number); } \n After learning about for loop and while loop, let\u0026rsquo;s see how do we help Patrick 🐥 and calculate 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 \u0026hellip; + 99 + 100 easily?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s try to do it in a while loop:\n We have a variable called total that tracks the total addition sum we get so far. We have a variable called num that tracks the next number to be added to total. Write out the appropriate boolean expression and write out the while loop.  By following those step we will get a while loop like this:\nint total = 0; int num = 1; while(num \u0026lt;= 100){ total = total + num; num = num + 1; } System.out.println(\u0026#34;Answer calculated in a while loop: \u0026#34; + total); Test this out below by clicking Run and write a for loop version that calculates the same thing! You should get the same answer!\n "},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-basics/functions/","title":"Functions","tags":[],"description":"","content":" Functions are a way to organize pieces of similar or repeating code. Rather than having to constantly type out the same code, we can put the desired code in a function and call it whenever we want to use it.\nNote: The purpose of a function is to help reduce redundant code throughout the program.\n Creating a function Define your function - name \u0026amp; parameters To make a function in python, we must use the def keyword. This keyword tells the code editor where the function is defined. def is followed by the name of the function. In order to generalize the function (so that we can use it at multiple places), we might need to send some information to it. This is achieved using parameters. They are placed in between parentheses () and follows right after the name of the function. If no parameters are needed, they can be ignored. The function declaration ends with a colon. Here\u0026rsquo;s what a function looks like:\nMake sure that the first line of your function always ends with a colon :\n Write the function body In Python, indentation defines which code is controlled by the function. For example, look at the following image: The code that is indented underneath the sectionA function is the code that is executed each time function sectionA is called.\nWarning: Since identation is very important in Python, make sure that the body of the function always starts with 2 spaces.\n Using the function - Function call To call a function, input the name of the function and its parameters wherever you want to execute the function. For example, in order to call function sectionA, we would do something like this: Be careful: When making a function in Python, you must define the function and its contents before it is called. In other words, in the code, you need to put the function declaration above the function call. Otherwise, you will receive a NameError like below. See the following figure for an example:  Challenge 1 - Create your own function! Challenge: Create a function called addNumbers that takes 2 parameters called number1 \u0026amp; number2 and prints the sum on console. Call the function addNumbers with parameters 3 \u0026amp; 5. What is printed on the console?\n Challenge 2 Let’s try to create some simple math functions. Create a function called add that takes in two parameters, number1 and number2, and return the sum of the two numbers.\nFirst copy the structure of the triple function. Change the triple function name, and replace the parameter number with number1 and number2, separated with a comma. Both number1 and number2 should be int, and don’t forget to add number1 and number2 together!\n To check that your function is working correctly, add the following code after your function definition, which calls the function add() and save its value in a variable. For example:\n value2 = add(2, 3) print(\"This should print 5: \" + str(value2))  Challenge 3 Can you create functions for subtraction, multiplication, and division?\nTest the functions out by calling each function, saving its return value, then printing it out to the console.\n"},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/web-basics/html-attributes/","title":"HTML Attributes","tags":[],"description":"","content":"HTML Attributes Each tag can also have additional information like style attributes that can change the properties of an element.

With this tool, we are training a model/computer to analyze various training images/data, likely labeled in advance, and perform and execute a specific task as a result. In our scenario, we are using pre-labeled images of clothing to train our model to correctly predict the type of clothing for any clothing sample we input.\nNeural Network Take a look at these two images.\nAs we can see from these images, we have two sneakers. How do we know this, even though the images themselves and their pixel values vary significantly? Our brain interprets these images by looking at patterns we observed before and says \u0026ldquo;That is a sneaker!\u0026rdquo;\nAnd why is this called a sneaker? Everyone at some point has collectively agreed that this is different from other types of shoes because sneakers have laces, long snouts, thick rubber soles, and cover your feet upto your ankles. This is what we were probably told as kids- to identify these types of shoes as sneakers.\nHow is this relevant to what we are doing next? We will need to tell the computer that these types of images are sneakers. We cannot just hard code these two images as sneakers because this would be ineffective when predicting future inputs using this model.\nMoreover, we don\u0026rsquo;t have to stop with only sneakers to categorize images- we can use multiple categories to classify images (Recall creating the list of different clothing categories in Activity 1). In the end, these are the categories we are using to sort all the clothing apparel.\nWhat is a Neural Network? The concept of the Neural Network originated from the idea of replicating the human brain, more specifically its ability to recognize patterns. In fact word \u0026lsquo;neural\u0026rsquo; is a derivation of the word \u0026lsquo;neuron\u0026rsquo;, which are receptors in the brain that fire off, for example, when it sees an image or an object it recognizes.\nIn this case, we are training the computer to recognize what each image is (whether its a shoe, a shirt, a bag, etc.), so our main goal of utilizing the neural network in this workshop is to give the computer the ability to classify images from the dataset into different categories.\nThe image below shows a simple implementation of a neural network.\n The input layer is reponsible to feed data into the system, pointing to different neurons to train the model. The hidden layer constitutions of many neurons, which are responsible for recognizing the different patterns from the input data. These nodes then point to the output layer. The output layer consists of a single node or multiple nodes that return an output value which the model predicts.  Simply put, a neural network is a system, or an algorithm, that trains the computer to recognize different types of patterns.\nHow is related to what we are doing? We would recommend looking at the first code block below and the Neural Network diagram to better understand the relationship between them and the following points.\n  The input layer takes the different types of images from the dataset and feeds it into the neurons (the hidden layer). The neurons (128 of them) then recognize different patterns in the images by observing different features and the relationships between them and the predetermined categories. This layer gives the computer the ability to categorize images on its own. The output layer consists of 10 different nodes, representing the 10 different categories we would sort the images by. Depending on the specific image and the way the computer was trained by the neurons, The output will be the highest predicted category for that particular image.

As a result, the competitiveness of the computer is fairly low.\nIn this exercise, we want to increase the difficulty of the game by making optimal decisions for the computer.\nWe will do so by adding artificial intelligence into our program with the use the Minimax algorithm (a well-defined procedure that allows computers to solve problems).\nMinimax Algorithm Minimax is an algorithm that is used in two-player games to make optimal decisions for a player.\n The two players are labeled as maximizer and minimizer respectedly. While the maximizer maximizes its chance to win, the minimizer tries to minimize its loss. The algorithm examines all the possible future game states based on the current game board assuming both the maximizer and minimizer will pick the move that benefits them the most. In our case, we pick the computer to be the maximizer, and the player to be the minimizer. We will attempt to make optimal decision for the computer by maximize its chance to win!  How will Minimax Algorithm work in TicTacToe?   We examine all the possible moves of \u0026quot;X\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;O\u0026quot; and give a score to a game board if there is a winner or tie.\n  Since we want the computer to win with the fewest steps possible, we design the score for the game boards as the following:\n If computer wins, calculate the score with the formula 1 * (number of available spots on the board + 1). If the player wins, calculate the score with the formula -1 * (number of available spots on the board + 1). If there is a tie, the score is 0. Note that by giving larger scores to game states where the computer can win with fewer steps, we are teaching our code to pick the optimal move for the computer.    Let\u0026rsquo;s look at an example below:\n  In the first row, we considered the 3 possible moves for the computer \u0026quot;O\u0026quot;, who is the maximizer.\n  We examine all the game states until all the moves end will a computer win, player win, or a tie. We then give them their corresponding score.\nFor example, in the second board in row 1, the computer wins by placing \u0026quot;O\u0026quot; at position 8. That state will then be given a score of 1 * (number of available spots on the board + 1) = 1 * (2+1) = 3.\n  At game states that don\u0026rsquo;t have a winner or a tie, we pick the smallest score during minimizing rounds (when \u0026quot;X\u0026quot; make a move), and the largest score during maximizing rounds (when \u0026quot;O\u0026quot; make a move).\n  If you follow along through the maximizing/minimizing rounds on the picture above, you should note that the optimal move for the computer is to place \u0026quot;O\u0026quot; at position 8, allowing the computer to win with 1 move from the starting game board.\n  Code Structure In activity-3, you wrote the method int getComputerMove(String[] curBoard) to randomly generate a spot for the computer. Let\u0026rsquo;s write another method called getComputerMoveAI(String[] curBoard) that returns the optimal move for the computer by calling the int minimax(String[] curBoard, boolean isMaximizing) method.\nint getComputerMove(String[] curBoard){ // 1. this method calls minimax() on all the possible moves the computer can pick  // 2. it takes the maximum out of all of them  // 3. return the optimal move } int minimax(String[] curBoard, boolean isMaximizing){ // 1. In the maximizing round, it calls minimax() on all the possible moves for the computer, \u0026#34;O\u0026#34;, return the maximum score  // 2. In the minimizing round, it calls minimax() on all the possible moves for the player, \u0026#34;X\u0026#34;, return the minimum score }  The method minimax() is a recursive function, which means that the function calls itself inside of the implementation of itself. In our method, minimax() call itself with different possible boards by placing \u0026quot;X\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;O\u0026quot; at each available spots. And, the method pick either maximum or minimum score depending on whether its a maximizing round. \n Write the Method getComputerMoveAI()  For each available spot on the game board, place \u0026quot;O\u0026quot; at that spot and get the score for that board by calling minimax().   Note you should pass false for the second argument since it\u0026rsquo;d be the minimizer\u0026rsquo;s turn. You should change that spot back to \u0026quot; \u0026quot; after getting the score, so you maintain the original state of the game board during the next iteration. \n Track the largest score and its corresponding position of the board at each iteration. Return the position with the largest score.   Have a variable called bestScore that stores the current best score and have an initial value of Integer.MIN_VALUE (minimum value of an integer). This is an useful way to find the maximum value in a data structure. For example:  public int getLargestNum() { // the following code find the maximum value in the array \u0026#34;nums\u0026#34;  int[] nums = {3, 5, -2, 10}; int largestNum = Integer.MIN_VALUE; for(int i = 0; i \u0026lt; nums.length; i++){ if(nums[i] \u0026gt; largestNum){ largestNum = nums[i]; } } return largestNum; } \n Write the Method minimax() As we discussed above, the minimax() method has the header int minimax(String[] curBoard, boolean isMaximizing).\n  Call getWinner() on the board to check if there is a winner. If so, return the corresponding score\n(Score: computer wins (1 * number of available spots on the board + 1), player wins (-1 * number of available spots on the board + 1), tie (0)).\n  Get Minimax Score\n    If it\u0026rsquo;s maximizer\u0026rsquo;s turn (\u0026quot;O\u0026quot;), for each available spot on the game board, place \u0026quot;O\u0026quot; at that spot and get the score for that board by calling minimax().\n  If it\u0026rsquo;s minimizer\u0026rsquo;s turn (\u0026quot;X\u0026quot;), for each available spot on the game board, place \u0026quot;X\u0026quot; at that spot and get the score for that board by calling minimax().\n  Return Largest Score    If it\u0026rsquo;s maximizer\u0026rsquo;s turn (\u0026quot;O\u0026quot;), track the largest score and the corresponding position at each iteration, and return that score.\n  If it\u0026rsquo;s minimizer\u0026rsquo;s turn (\u0026quot;X\u0026quot;), track the smallest score and the corresponding position at each iteration, and return that score.\n  Test your methods Copy and paste your two methods below main().\nClick Run to test around your methods.

(We\u0026rsquo;ll learn about classes on the next page!)\n  return type. void means the method doesn\u0026rsquo;t return anything.\n  method name.\n  list of parameters/ user inputs in the format of (type input name, type input name, \u0026hellip; ).\n  // an example public void sing (String songName) 1. 2. 3. 4. \nMethod Body Next, we put the block of code associated with the method in the method body, which is between { and } after the method header.\nTo return some data, we put the keyword return followed by a variable name or a value to be returned.\nThis is an example of how to define a method that sum of numbers from numA through numB:\n/* Method Name: sumNum * Input/Parameter: 2 numbers of type int * Funtionality: return the sum from numA through numB */ public int sumNum(int numA, int numB){ int total = 0; int num = numA; // we access the first input with the name numA  while(num \u0026lt;= numB){ // we access the first input with the name numB  total = total + num; num = num + 1; } return total; // return statement } \nMethod Call Lastly, to execute a method in your code, we need to make a method call. We write out the method name with appropriate input. For example:\nsumNum(1, 3); // one line of code that calls method sumNum() with the return value 6 Knowing sumNum(1, 3) returns an int with the sum from 1 to 3, we can do the following to store the value:\nint sum1to3 = sumNum(1, 3); \n 2.

But we also need to tell it how to display the elements, and where to place them. We may want the title on the center or on the right side. We may want a picture on the right and a paragraph on the left. There are two ways we can do this: through HTML attributes or Cascading Style Sheets.\nCascading Style Sheets (CSS) HTML attributes are straight-forward but they can become messy quickly. If we wish to do a lot of styling, each HTML element can become long and hard to read. Furthermore, what if we want to style many elements the same way? We would have to copy all the attributes for each element, which is not efficient and prone to mistakes. For most styling, it’s better to use CSS.\nCSS files work closely with HTML tags. Each HTML tag can have a class attribute and/or an id attribute that helps to identify each element. Many elements can have the same class, and an element can have multiple classes. However, an element can only have one single id, and the id cannot be shared among elements. The CSS file uses these attributes to display styling specific to each class or id.\nSee this example below:\nSee the Pen Styling it up by Deliana Escobari (@Sunny-Dee) on CodePen.\n\rClick the \"HTML\" tab on the top left corner to see the HTML code, and the \"CSS\" tab to see the CSS code.\rLet\u0026rsquo;s take a look at the HTML code. Try to find a \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; tag with the attribute \u0026quot;info\u0026quot;. It looks like \u0026lt;div id=\u0026quot;info\u0026rdquo;\u0026gt;. By giving this div an id, we can then use CSS to specify styling for this specific element.\nSwitch over to the CSS file. We can also give styling to all elements of a specific type - for example, we could use CSS give all \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; elements the same style. In the header block, we tell the browser to color all the headers #0097A7 (which is the teal color).\nLet\u0026rsquo;s talk about the syntax (or the way of writing) for CSS. First, you start with what element you want to style. If you want to style all elements with the same tag (such as \u0026lt;header\u0026gt;), simply write the name. If you want to style an element with a class or id, put a . or a # in front of the class or id name respectively. Then, for each property you wish to change, use the format attribute-name: value;. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to end each line with a ;. All these styles should be surrounded by the curly braces { and }.\nThere are way too many style elements to cover them all in this tutorial. If, in the sketch you made earlier, you aren\u0026rsquo;t sure how to use CSS to accomplish the desired styling, try searching online.\nWhile CSS understands 140 color names such as \u0026ldquo;green\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;red\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;blue\u0026rdquo;, this can still be limiting. What about if we want a dark green, or a slightly lighter green? To achieve this, we can also refer to colors in hexadecimal or RGB form. Check this link to see the colors and their corresponding hexadecimal form.\n\rAdding a new font As you might know, there are multiple fonts that you can use. This part will show you how to import different fonts to your site.\n Let\u0026rsquo;s import the Heebo font from the internet. First we import the font at the top of the CSS file with this statement: @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Heebo|Open+Sans'); Then we assigned it to the body tag. Since this tag will contain all the other HTML elements, our choice of font will be used for all elements.   Notice that the format inside the curly braces is: name: value;  @import url(\u0026lsquo;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto+Mono'); \nfont-family: 'Roboto Mono', monospace; @import url(\u0026lsquo;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Indie+Flower');\nfont-family: 'Indie Flower', cursive; @import url(\u0026lsquo;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Pacifico'); \nfont-family: 'Pacifico', cursive; @import url(\u0026lsquo;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Permanent+Marker');\nfont-family: 'Permanent Marker', cursive;    Acivity 2 - Adding attributes and style   Open the web editor (click the \u0026ldquo;Try it yourself!\u0026rdquo; button below)\n  Add an id attribute to one of the header tag. For example, \u0026lt;header id=\u0026quot;page-title\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\n  Toggle to the CSS tab #page-title\r{\rstyling here...\r} \n  Change the title color by adding color: yellow; inside the curly braces\n  Change the font by adding font-family: \u0026lsquo;Roboto Mono\u0026rsquo;, monospace; inside the curly braces and adding @import url(\u0026lsquo;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto+Mono'); at the top of the CSS tab\n  Try it yourself!\n"},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/pygame-pong/activity-4/","title":"Activity 4 - Change the key assignment to move right paddle.","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Activity 4 Now you know how to change key assignments to control a paddle\u0026rsquo;s movement.

But this is just one of many hexagons Alex needs to build his honeycomb. Once again, it seems that we would have to repeat the code many times to draw multiple hexagons. Fortunately, we don\u0026rsquo;t have to! Functions to the rescue!\nFunctions A function is a way to group together lines of code to do something. For instance, turtle.forward(50) moves the turtle forward 50 steps, and turtle.left(120) turns the turtle left 120 degrees. What if we want to always do these two actions together? We can put them in a function called draw_line(), so that whenever this function is called, both of these actions take place simultaneously. Think of this like a recipe: we compile all the instructions together, and the recipe\u0026rsquo;s name is the food we are making.\n Here is an example of a function definition, and how we would use it:\ndef draw_line(): turtle.forward(50) turtle.left(120) The first line is called the function definition header. The def keyword tells the computer that we are defining a new function. Next, we give the function a name, in this case draw_line. Finally, don\u0026rsquo;t forget the (): at the end of the line, which tells the computer that we are starting the function body.\nExtra material - parameters Inside the parentheses () we would normally define parameters for the function. Parameters are inputs that we can give into the function, which the function can use to produce its output. For example, we must have two numbers to add them together and produce a result - the two numbers we used can be considered parameters. Today, we will not use parameters, and leave it as ().\n Similar to a for-loop, anything that we wish to define within the function needs to be preceded by 1 tab.\nIf you press run with just this code, you will notice that you won\u0026rsquo;t see any output! We\u0026rsquo;ve only created the functions, but we need to use them. To use the function we created, type in draw_line() again, but without the def.\ndef draw_line(): # Function definition turtle.forward(50) turtle.left(120) draw_line() # Function call This is called a function call for the draw_line() function. A function call runs the code that’s defined in the function with the same name. With the recipe analogy, think of it as actually performing the recipe.\nTips  Always make sure the names of your functions are descriptive enough to explain what the code in the function does. Your function call must be below the function definition. \n Tricky Python syntax - Part 2 Notice that functions use similar syntax rules with for-loops - you must have a : at the end of the function declaration, and anything in the function body needs to start with a tab.\nWhat happens when you need a for-loop inside of a function? Then, you need to combine the rules together! Here is an example on how to properly put a for-loop inside of a function.\ndef draw_line(): for i in range(3): turtle.forward(50) Notice that turtle.forward(50) has 2 tabs in front of it, because it is both inside of a function definition, and inside of a for-loop!\n So, let’s try that out by making our own draw_hexagon() function! Remember to include the function definition header, the number of sides a hexagon has, and the angle associated with a hexagon: 60 degrees.\n "},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/microbit-distance-checker/running-code/","title":"Downloading the code and trying it out","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Now that our code has been written, it\u0026rsquo;s time to try it all out.

The frame rate is essentially the speed of the animation. Repeat essentially refers to how many times the animation repeats when played, and a negative number means that the animation plays infinitely.\nThe next step is to simply tell the game to play the animation specified in our instructions.

Creating a Class! Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means everything in Java is associated with an object and a class (the blueprint for the object).\nFor starters, the line of code that we used to print statements from activity 1 is actually a method call from a predefined class called System!\nSystem.out.println(\u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34;);  System is a class that deals with user input and outputs. out is a variable in class System of the class/type PrintStream. println() is a method defined in the class PrintStream.  \nAnother class we have interacted with in the previous exercises is String. The String class defines a set of rules on how a list of characters should behave.\nWith following line of code, we created a String object called name using the rules defined in the String class:\nString name = \u0026#34;Patrick\u0026#34;; \nSystem, PrintStream, and String are predefined classes in Java. However, we are not limited to these predefined classes, and we can actually create our own data type by writing a class! This is useful for coders to create specific objects to have certain attributes and behaviors. Having access to these user-defined types allows us to build distinct programs.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s learn about the different parts in a class below:\nClass A class is a blueprint or prototype of a new type of object. In general, a class contains three important parts: (1) data fields/instance variables (2) constructor (3) methods.\n  data fields/instance variables: These are the variables an object of this class has access to. For example: A Car class may have the field tire of class Tire.\n  constructor: This is a method we call to create an object of this Class.\n  methods: These are methods an object of this class will be able to call to perform certain tasks.\n  For example:\npublic class SampleClass{ // (1) data fields/instance variables  private String name; // example  // (2) constructor  public SampleClass(){ name = \u0026#34;example\u0026#34;; } // (3) methods  public sampleMethod(){} } \n 2. Try it Out 🐥! Let\u0026rsquo;s make a Bird class to represent Patrick 🐥 and all of his Bird friends by following the steps below!\n First, we start by defining the class name in the format public class name. public class Bird{} \nSecond, let\u0026rsquo;s declare all the fields of the Bird class: species, name, hobby, age, loveMusic. Each field is declared in the format: private data type name ;.\n  We declare all 5 fields as private in the class Bird. This ensures these data can only be accessed within this class.\n  Let\u0026rsquo;s identify the appropriate type for each field:\n   species should be a String that stores for exmaple: \u0026ldquo;duck\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;swan\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;owl\u0026rdquo;. name should be a String that stores for example: \u0026ldquo;Patrick\u0026rdquo;. hobby should be a String that stores for example: \u0026ldquo;play basketball\u0026rdquo;. age should be an int that stores for example: 25. loveMusic should be a boolean that stores either true or false.  For example, to declare species as a private field of class Bird, you would put private String species; .\nFinish creating the other 4 fields of the Bird class!  \nThird, let\u0026rsquo;s create the constructor for the class Bird. Usually, constructor is the method that initialializes value to all the fields in a class. It has the format public class name (parameter). Since we have 5 fields in this class, the constructor will take in 5 parameter/inputs.\npublic Bird(String speciesInput, String nameInput, String hobbyInput, int ageInput, boolean loveMusicInput){ // constructor body } In the constructor body, we need to initialize all the instance variables, by assign each variables to its initial values:\nspecies = speciesInput; name = nameInput; hobby = hobbyInput; age = ageInput; loveMusic = loveMusicinput; \nLastly, let\u0026rsquo;s create some methods for the class Bird. We are gonna create 6 methods for this class!\n getSpecies(); // return species of the bird getName(); // return name of the bird getHobby(); // return hobby of the bird getAge(); // return age of the bird getLoveMusic(); // return whether the bird loves music toString(); // return information in a String  Try to write out the first 5 methods with what you learned from the previous exercise about writing methods!\n\nAfter, let\u0026rsquo;s write the toString() method together!\ntoString() is a method that returns the String representation of the object.\nWe will return a String that include all fields of the Bird: name, age, species, hobby, loveMusic by calling the 5 methods you just implemented!\npublic String toString(){ // initialize variable info to have empty String  String info = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; // append information to the String in the format:  // Hi, my name is [name]. I am a [age] year old [species] who likes to [hobby].  info = info + \u0026#34;Hi, my name is \u0026#34; + getName() + \u0026#34;. I am a \u0026#34; + getAge() + \u0026#34; year old \u0026#34; + getSpecies() + \u0026#34; who likes to \u0026#34; + getHobby() + \u0026#34;. \u0026#34;; // if the Bird likes music, append the String \u0026#34;I also like music very much!\u0026#34; to info  if(getLoveMusic()){ info = info + \u0026#34;I also like music very much!\u0026#34;; }else{ info = info + \u0026#34;However, I do not like music!\u0026#34;; } // return the full String  return info; } If you correctly implemented the Bird class, you will see the following message when you click Run:\nCongratulations! You correctly implemented the Bird Class :) If there is still something incomplete or incorrect when you click Run:\n You might get an error such as Main.java:3: error: cannot access Bird. Or, you will see the message, Something is still not quite right!.   3. Creating Birds 🐥! Congratulations! You just wrote you first Java class Bird class. Now let\u0026rsquo;s learn to write a program that uses Bird objects!\nWe defined the Bird class to have the following attributes (instance variables) and behaviors (methods): To create a new object of a particular class, we call the constructor of that class in the format class name variable name = new constructor call.\nRecall that the constructor of Bird class is the following:\npublic Bird(String speciesInput, String nameInput, String hobbyInput, int ageInput, boolean loveMusicInput); Hence, we can create a Bird with these attributes (species - duck; name - Patrick; hobby - hangout with friends; age - 15; loveMusic - true) with this line of code.\nBird patrick = new Bird(\u0026#34;duck\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Patrick\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;hangout with friends\u0026#34;, 15, true); Try it out yourself and create multiple Birds of different species 🐦🐤🐔🐧!\n\nNext, let\u0026rsquo;s call the toString() method on these Bird objects we created to print the information of our friends. You can do either of the following:\n Print the return value of toString() method. (i.e. System.out.println(patrick.toString());) Directly print the Bird object, which prompt toString() to be called in the background. (i.e. System.out.println(patrick);).  Try it out and print out all the information of the bird friends you created 🐦🐤🐔🐧!\n "},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/jsappybird/gravity/","title":"Add gravity","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Let\u0026rsquo;s add gravity to the bird:\nAdd below command in the file [File: create-game.js] bird.body.gravity.y = 900;\nWorking Together In the repl.it window below, we started the code with the line bird.body.gravity.y = 900;.\nIn your console you should see a JSappy bird jumping with gravity after you press run:\n"},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/web-basics/media-elements/","title":"Media Elements","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Add a GIF GIF stands for Graphic Interchange Format, but all you need to know is that it\u0026rsquo;s just another type of image file.

Think of it like one of those flip books that seem like the image is animated when you flip it.\n Add a video Aside from text and images, one of the most common things we like to add to websites are videos. Video files are very large, so it’s best to use a service to upload and display the video such as YouTube. Once uploaded to YouTube, how do we get it to play on our website? We use a special tag called an iframe\nIframes display HTML from other websites inside our own.

But, what if we want to store a bunch of similiar data? Is there a good way to organize them without declaring multiple variables?\nIn programming, data structures are structures that allowed coders to store multiple pieces of data of the same type. Using data structures is an efficient way to store and access large pieces of data. In this exercise, we will learn about 2 data structures used in Java: array and ArrayList.\nWhile array is a fixed length data structure, ArrayList is a variable lengthed where you can change the size of the data structure. Let\u0026rsquo;s start by looking at arrays!\n1. Array Let\u0026rsquo;s say we want to store Patrick\u0026rsquo;s 🐥 top 5 favorite movies. Instead of creating 5 variables, we can store all 5 pieces of data in an array, our first data structure!\nTo store data in an array, we do the following:\n We first declare an array by specifying a data type and size (number of data can be stored).  String topMovies[] = new String[5]; // create an array of Strings of size 5. We iterate through the array (go through all the data spots) and assign the data to a spot in the array.  Note that we access the array with its name and an index (0 to access the 1st element, 1 for the 2nd \u0026hellip; ).\ntopMovies[0] = \u0026#34;Birds Of Prey\u0026#34;; topMovies[1] = \u0026#34;The Birds\u0026#34;; topMovies[2] = \u0026#34;Angry Birds\u0026#34;; topMovies[3] = \u0026#34;Bird Box\u0026#34;; topMovies[4] = \u0026#34;The Secret Life of Pets\u0026#34;; // the array topMovies now store \u0026#34;Birds Of Prey\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;The Birds\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Angry Birds\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Bird Box\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;The Secret Life of Pets\u0026#34; in order Why is array indexing in Java start with 0? It\u0026rsquo;s tempting and reasonable to think to access the element of an array at the first index, we should start at index 1.\nHowever, when the computer read the code arr[1], it doesn\u0026rsquo;t think to get the 1st element from arr.\nIt actually reads arr[1] as to get the element 1 distance from the start of the array.\nIn other words, the index is actually a memory offset. To access the 1st element, we should get the element of 0 offset from the start of the array (i.e. arr[0]).\n An alternating way to create an array: If we know all pieces of data for an array in advance, we can create the array in one line by listing all the data between { and }.\nFor example:\nString topMovies[] = {\u0026#34;Birds Of Prey\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;The Birds\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Angry Birds\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Bird Box\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;The Secret Life of Pets\u0026#34;}; Just like how we initialize data with its index, we can access/modify each data with its index as well.\nFor example:\nString movie1 = topMovies[0]; // movie1 has value \u0026#34;Birds Of Prey\u0026#34; \n It is often useful to know how many elements are an array after creating it (to access the last element in the array for example). And, we can get the number of elements in the array from the length field of the array, typing array_name.length.\nFor example:\nint numOfMovie = topMovies.length; // numOfMovie has value 5 \nExercise: Write a method printArr() that takes an array input and prints out all the elements in that array in order (Hint: utilize for loop and .length to help you).\nAfter clicking Run, the program should print the following:\nBirds Of Prey, The Birds, Angry Birds, Bird Box, The Secret Life of Pets  2. ArrayList ArrayList is another popular data structure in Java. ArrayList is a class that was implemented using arrays. It is similiar to an array that user access, store, and modify data by an index.\nYou create an ArrayList by specifying a name and the type between \u0026lt; and \u0026gt;. For example:\nArrayList\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; topMoviesList = new ArrayList\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;(); To add elements, we call the method add() on the ArrayList. For example:\ntopMoviesList.add(\u0026#34;Birds Of Prey\u0026#34;); topMoviesList.add(\u0026#34;The Birds\u0026#34;); topMoviesList.add(\u0026#34;Angry Birds\u0026#34;); topMoviesList.add(\u0026#34;Bird Box\u0026#34;); topMoviesList.add(\u0026#34;The Secret Life of Pets\u0026#34;); // the ArrayList now store \u0026#34;Birds Of Prey\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;The Birds\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Angry Birds\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Bird Box\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;The Secret Life of Pets\u0026#34; in order To access an element at a particular index, we call the method get(). Note that Java use 0-based indexing, so to get the first element in an ArrayList we make a method call get(0). For example:\nString movie1 = topMoviesList.get(0); // movie1 has value \u0026#34;Birds Of Prey\u0026#34; And, to get the number of elements in the ArrayList, we call the method size(). For example:\nint numOfMovie2 = topMoviesList.size(); // numOfMovie2 has value 5 \nAs we briefly mentioned above, the critical difference between array and ArrayList is that you need to know number of elements to store in an array upfront, but you do not for an ArrayList.\n  With the line of code String topMovies[] = new String[5] the array topMovies will forever have length 5. As a result, you can\u0026rsquo;t store more than 5 Strings in topMovies after creating it.\n  However, with the line of code ArrayList\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; topMoviesList = new ArrayList\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;(), the ArrayList starts with 0 element and can be infinitely added to or remove from.\n  To remove an element from an ArrayList, we call the method remove(). For example:\nSystem.out.print(topMoviesList.size()); // prints out 5 topMoviesList.remove(\u0026#34;Birds Of Prey\u0026#34;); System.out.print(topMoviesList.size()); // prints out 4 \nExercise: Write a method printList() that takes an ArrayList as input and prints out all the elements in that ArrayList in order (Hint: utilize for loop and size() to help you).\nAfter clicking Run, the program should print the following:\nBirds Of Prey, The Birds, Angry Birds, Bird Box, The Secret Life of Pets  End Of Workshop 🐥 Patrick 🐥 thank you for participating!

Similar to how we used fitMedia() to add new audio clips, we must use the setEffect() function to define specific effects for each audio clip. It is important to note that multiple effects can be placed on the same track. This allows for the producer to combine multiple effects together. Earsketch has many effects built-in. To reference all the effects, visit this link and make sure Curriculum pane is selected in the navigation bar.\nBefore we start adding effects to our song, let\u0026rsquo;s breakdown the pieces of the two setEffect functions:  track: The track number to which the effect is applied to. Note: To apply an effect to the Master track, use 0 as the value for track. The master track is where all the audio is collectively played together. This is an easy way to apply an effect to all the sounds being processed. effectType: The specific effect being used effectParameter: The setting for the effect being used effectValue: The value applied to the effectParameter  Add setEffect function to your song Since we are more familiar with using effects, let\u0026rsquo;s add an effect to our song.\n  On the API browser on the left, scroll to setEffect API.\n  Insert a setEffect function call into your code, using the paste icon.\n  We need to replace the parameters with our own values.

Click on it to open this section on the right side of your window.\n  You may notice that Earsketch has many different variations of effects. By default, you should see section 30.4 BANDPASS on the right. For now, we will use the DELAY from section 30.4 as effectType in our setEffect function call.\n  Now that we have chosen our effectType, we need an effectParameter. Navigate to section 30.4 on the right to check out different parameters supported for DELAY. Here is a picture of that section. We recommend using the DELAY_FEEDBACK.   For the final parameter, input a valid value. Since we have chosen DELAY_FEEDBACK, we must specify a number between -120.0 and -1.0 (as shown in the picture above). Example: Use -6.0 as your effect value for DELAY_FEEDBACK.\n  Your code should now look something like this:\nfrom earsketch import * init() setTempo(120) fitMedia(HOUSE_DEEP_CRYSTALCHORD_001, 3, 1, 5) fitMedia(HOUSE_DEEP_CRYSTALCHORD_002, 3, 5, 9) # Section A def sectionA(startMeasure, endMeasure): fitMedia(RD_UK_HOUSE__AIRYPAD_1, 1, startMeasure, endMeasure) fitMedia(HOUSE_MAIN_BEAT_002, 4, startMeasure, endMeasure) fitMedia(HOUSE_ROADS_BASS_001, 5, startMeasure, endMeasure) # Section B def sectionB(startMeasure, endMeasure): fitMedia(Y37_ORGAN_1, 2, startMeasure, endMeasure) fitMedia(HOUSE_ROADS_BASS_001, 5, startMeasure, endMeasure) fitMedia(RD_UK_HOUSE__ARPLEAD_1, 6, startMeasure, endMeasure) sectionA(1, 9) sectionB(9, 17) sectionA(17, 25) setEffect(2, DELAY, DELAY_FEEDBACK, -6.0) setEffect(2, DELAY, DELAY_TIME, 1200.0) finish() "},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/android-tictactoe/numbers/","title":"Numbers","tags":[],"description":"","content":"The computer can also do regular math that you see in school.

Give it few tries before you ask for help. Press run to confirm the result.\n  ## Takeaway You have just changed the way game exits by listening for a specific key press.

Then, with turtle.goto(x,y), we are telling the turtle the position where the turtle moves to. After that we tell the turtle to put its pen back down using turtle.pendown() so it can start drawing again.\nTip The x and y in the turtle.goto() method are the x and y coordinates of the turtle. We want to change the x and y coordinates of the turtle from (0, 0) which is center of the image, to somewhere a little further away so that the mandala flower doesn’t cover up part of the honeycomb.\n To complete this activity, move the turtle to position (300, 300) on the canvas.

Use the setEffect function with more parameters!  effectStartValue: The starting value applied to the parameter effectStartLocation: The measure at which the starting value is set effectEndValue: The ending value of the parameter effectEndLocation: The measure at which the ending value is set  This version of the setEffect allows for us to perform automation on a specific piece of our song. Automation is a way to change the value of an effect over time. One use of automation is to make a song fade in or fade out. To do so, we must adjust the GAIN effectParameter's volume in the VOLUME effectType over time. For example, if we define our effectStartValue at -60 db and our effectEndValue at 0 db, it will sound like our song is fading in over time. To adjust the starting point and length of the effect, specify the effectStartLocation and effectEndLocation.\nAdd another setEffect function to your song  Add another setEffect function call into your code, but ensure all 7 parameters are present in the call. Set the effectType to VOLUME. Use the \u0026ldquo;Every Effect Explained in Detail\u0026rdquo; reference guide to see which parameters VOLUME has. To adjust the loudness of an audio clip, use the GAIN effectParameter. If we want to make something sound like it is fading in, we must have the sound\u0026rsquo;s volume start at nothing and increase it until around 0 decibels. To do so, set effectStartValue at a very low value, and effectEndValue to be a higher value.  Hint: Volume is measured in decibels. In decibels, the more positive a number is, the louder it gets. Also, try not to exceed 0 decibels.\n Set values for effectStartLocation and effectEndLocation to specify when to start and stop the fade in effect.

To make this coding easier, we will use a concept in Phaser called a group to control all of our enemies at once A group is exactly what it sounds - a group of things.

To make this easier, we will use another helper method called createEnemies() (which again, has already been made for you with nothing inside of it):\nNow, call this method in the create() method instead of the update() method like we did for the player movement because we only want to spawn the enemy once at the beginning of the game:\nThe syntax for creating an enemy variable \u0026ldquo;enemy\u0026rdquo; at coordinate (X, Y), with the enemies sprite sheet, and within the enemies group that you declared earlier looks like this:\nvar enemies = this.enemies.create(X, Y, \u0026#39;enemies\u0026#39;); Activity 1: Placing an Enemy Try it out by choosing an (X, Y) coordinate and placing this line of code in the createEnemies() method.

We can do this by simply adding one line of code:\nenemy.body.velocity.x = -90; Place in our createEnemies() method:\nBut if you test out the code now, we can see that the enemies just keep going to the left infinitely because of Phaser’s infinite canvas. Let’s make them change direction before they go out of the screen. We can do this with a timer, a tool that lets us call a function after a certain period of time. The function that the timer calls will change the enemy\u0026rsquo;s direction. We can also make the timer run infinitely so that it continues to run the function after each time interval (which we are going to do here). Put this timer:\nthis.enemyTimer = this.time.addEvent({ delay: 1500, callback: this.changeEnemyDirection, callbackScope: this, loop: true }); at the end of the createEnemy() method:\nThis is a timer that continuously calls the changeEnemyDirection() method after a certain time interval.

Now let’s create the hurtPlayer() method:\nFirst we will destroy the enemy and disable the player for step 4 and 5 with these lines:\nenemy.destroy(); player.disableBody(true, true); This makes both the enemy and player disappear (the enemy has been deleted, but the player is just invisible and not interactable). Now let\u0026rsquo;s make the player revive after a short pause (the pause allows the player some time to react to the damage). For this pause, we will another timer (like we did for changing the enemy direction) by step 7. The syntax will be the same, but we will call the resetPlayer() function, have a shorter delay, and also not loop the timer.\nOnce you have the timer created, let\u0026rsquo;s work on the resetPlayer() method:\nFirst, choose a respawn coordiate and change the player\u0026rsquo;s (X, Y) value to this location (we can still change the ship\u0026rsquo;s location like this because it still exists, it\u0026rsquo;s just disabled). Then, enable the player with this line:\nthis.player.enableBody(true, x, y, true, true); Once you have implemented this, the collision should look like this: Next, let\u0026rsquo;s create a new explosion object by editing explosion.js:\nNotice that it extends Phaser.GameObjects.Sprite.This will allow us to use this Class’s constructor through inheritance. Our Projectile object’s parameter is simply just the scene and two numbers (x and y) - later you will see that we pass Scene 2 itself. We can use this scene to access everything within it. All this file will do is create an object that will play the explosion animation at the specified location. All the code this class needs is contained within the constructor, and there are only 2 lines of code that you need to fill in.\nNow, go to the hurtPlayer() method in scene2.js：\nyou will create two explosion objects:\n  one with the scene and player coordinates as parameters,\n  the other with the scene and enemy coordinates as parameters.\n   Next, notice how the player\u0026rsquo;s revival is a bit sudden. We will make this transition smoother with a tween after we spawn the player:\nA tween is essentially a tool that lets you animate a feature or characteristic of an object. For example, in this case, we are animating the player’s alpha (aka visibility). We will begin by setting the player’s alpha to 0.5 and then using the tween to animate it to full, normal visibility.\nvar tween = this.tweens.add({ targets: this.player, y: config.height - 64, ease: \u0026#39;Power1\u0026#39;, duration: 1500, repeat: 0, onComplete: function(){ this.player.alpha = 1; }, callbackScope: this }); Now we’re finally done! Now our player revival animation looks much cleaner!\n"},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-turtle/activity-10/","title":"Activity 10 - Randomizing the color of your mandala flower petals","tags":[],"description":"","content":"We’ve successfully set the color of the mandala flower to an RGB value.

This is a great time to use your knowledge of comments, numbers, variables, and reading from console to complete the 4 activities. Some background information for each activity is provided below, and hints are provided in the code. After each part, press run and make sure there are no errors present in the console.\nActivity 4.1 First, let\u0026rsquo;s introduce some more code into our game. Find the two lines of code which start with TODO (ACTIVITY 4.1) (one is at approximately line 60, and the other at approximately line 130). Delete both lines of code entirely. This unlocks the main behavior of the game, such as checking if the letter guessed by the player is found in the word to guess.\nUnfortunately, after pressing run, it seems like the game does not wait for user input, and continuously guesses 'C' instead! This is no good, so let\u0026rsquo;s fix this in the next part.\nActivity 4.2 When the player makes a guess, we need to take the guessed letter and store it in a variable. The variable will be used to check if the letter appears in the word to guess. Use Console.ReadLine to wait for user input and store the user input in the input variable. Note: we have already declared the variable input already, so you do not need to use the var keyword.\nTo check if you have done this correctly, press run, and you should now be able to type in a letter into the console.\nActivity 4.3 Every time a letter is guessed correctly, we need to increment (add one to) the number of correctly guessed letters. Use the lettersRevealed variable to change the number of correctly guessed letters. Press run to make sure no errors occur. We have also provided some code to print out the value of the lettersRevealed variable for testing purposes. Make sure to delete this when you are done testing, since this is something we do not want to reveal to the player!\nActivity 4.4 Every time a letter is guessed incorrectly, the player loses a life. Decrement (subtract one from) the number of lives, using the lives variable. We will also tell the player how many lives they have remaining, when they make an incorrect guess, by printing the number of lives to the console. Check if you have done this correctly by pressing run, guessing an incorrect letter, and seeing if the correct number of lives are displayed on the console.\nFun Fact - Bugs Recall in Activity 4.1 that after uncommenting some code, we experienced some unexpected behavior. Any problems or unexpected behaviors in the program are called \u0026ldquo;bugs\u0026rdquo;. We fixed the bug introduced in Activity 4.1 by introducing user input in Activity 4.2.\nEven if you implemented everything correctly in the previous parts, if you keep playing for a while, another issue still occurs. What is it? We will fix this bug in Activity 6.\n "},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/linux-basics/activity-11/","title":"Activity 11 - Store and protect files","tags":[],"description":"Use Linux commands to compress and archive files.","content":"Thanks so much for helping us fix my machine!

Although we can defeat enemies by crashing into them, this won\u0026rsquo;t be a good idea once we add lives later. We will create a shooting effect by creating an object for the beam using a separate JavaScript file (like we did for the explosion).\nWe will start with some basic stuff - loading a spritesheet and animation in Scene 1 for the player\u0026rsquo;s beams:\nThe location of the spritesheet is assets/beam.png and the frame width and height is 32:\nNow in Scene 2, we will do something similar to what we did with the enemies and create a group for the beams so that we can easily manipulate them. Create a group and name it \u0026ldquo;projectiles\u0026rdquo;:\nNow go to playerBeam.js：\nNotice that, like Explosion.js, it extends Phaser.GameObjects.Sprite and uses the super() keyword in its constructor. Complete the code in the constructor. This will require that you play the beam\u0026rsquo;s animation, enable the body, and set the beam\u0026rsquo;s y-velocity to whatever speed you want your beam to travel.\nNow that we have the basics of the beam down, let’s allow the player to shoot it when they click the spacebar. Similar to how we created a variable to process pointer keys for player movement, we will create another variable to process when the player presses the space bar:\nWe will now create a playerShoot() method:\nand call it in the update() method like we did for the movePlayer():\nThe playerShoot method will check if the spacebar has been pressed and fire a beam if it has. \u0026ldquo;Firing a beam\u0026rdquo;, in this case, means creating a playerBeam object and adding it to the projectiles group if the player is active (still alive).\nTest it out now! There are two big issues here however - the beam doesn’t harm the enemy at all and the beam also keeps going forever because of phaser’s infinite canvas. Let’s fix that second issue first. Although this issue doesn\u0026rsquo;t directly affect the gameplay, it could potentially be an issue because if the beam still exists off screen, then that means the computer has to waste time tending to it. If there are too many beams for the computer to take care of, it could potentially cause lag! What we will do is utilize an update function in playerBeam.js that will destroy the beam if it goes off screen.\nThe only way to make these update functions work, however, is to call them in the update function in our Scene 2 like this:\nfor(var i = 0; i \u0026lt; this.projectiles.getChildren().length; i++) { var beam = this.projectiles.getChildren()[i]; beam.update(); } you can fill it into this location:\nNow, to test this, we can simply change the height value that the beam self-destructs to one that is on the screen:\nThe code is working correctly if the beam disappears at the specific height. After we test that the code works, we can simply change this value to one that is above the screen.\nYou can see in this gif that the beam is disappearing once it hits a specified height (we used 50). Again, after confirming that it works, we can simply change the number 50 to one that is a bit off screen (like 10) and we know that the code is probably still working the same.\nNow, lets make the enemy be destroyed if they’re hit with a beam! We can actually just do this with a similar overlap detection that we did to check if the player is touching the enemy:\nCreate a line of code that uses the same syntax as the line we used for detecting whether the player and enemy have collided, but this time check if the enemy and beam have collided.\nHowever, we can’t use the hurtPlayer() method because the player isn’t being hurt and we don’t want the player to respawn when the enemy is hit. We will create a new function called hitEnemy():\nAdd code to the hitEnemy() so that it creates an explosion at the enemy’s location and removes the beam and the enemy.\nAt the end, the shooting should look like this!

Here is an example:\nvar myNum = (93 + 41) / 12; if (myNum == 11) { Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;They are equal!\u0026#34;); } Inside the () beside if, you should specify a boolean expression. If the expression is true, the code inside { } is executed. In this case, since myNum is equal to 11, They are equal! is printed.\nIf the condition is false, nothing happens! For example, since 10 is not greater than 11, Print me! will not show up to the console.\nvar happy = 10; if (happy \u0026gt; 11) { Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Print me!\u0026#34;); } Use else to tell the computer what to do if the condition is false. In this example, now I got printed instead! will be printed to the console.\nvar happy = 10; if (happy \u0026gt; 11) { Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Print me!\u0026#34;); } else { Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;I got printed instead!\u0026#34;); } You can chain many cases together using else if. Note that when using else if, only the first case will be evaluated. For example, in the following code snippet, Statement 1 will be printed. We will skip the check that sad == 4 and Statement 2 will not be printed, even though sad == 4 is true.\nvar sad = 4; if (sad \u0026lt; 9) { Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Statement 1\u0026#34;); } else if (sad == 4) { Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Statement 2\u0026#34;); } else { Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Statement 3\u0026#34;); } You can also place if statements inside other if statements for some interesting behavior:\nvar num1 = 10; var num2 = 20; if (num1 \u0026lt; num2) { if (num2 \u0026lt; 30) { Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Hello!\u0026#34;); } else { Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Hola!\u0026#34;); } } Working Together Let\u0026rsquo;s write a program that first prints the following line to console:\nIs coding fun? Afterwards, the console waits for user input.\n If the user enters yes, the computer prints out Yes, I'm glad you're enjoying it!. If the user enters no, the computer prints out Oh no, that's too bad!. Otherwise, the computer prints out: I don't understand you! Goodbye!.    Fun Fact: Switch statements Using multiple if, else statements could get very long and confusing. You can use switch statements instead if you want to compare a single variable against multiple values. For example, the Working Together activity can be completed using the following piece of code:\nvar input = Console.ReadLine(); switch (input) { case \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34;: Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Yes, I\u0026#39;m glad you\u0026#39;re enjoying it!\u0026#34;); break; case \u0026#34;no\u0026#34;: Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Oh no, that\u0026#39;s too bad!\u0026#34;); break; default: Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;I don\u0026#39;t understand you! Goodbye!\u0026#34;); break; } Each case represents a possible value that the variable input might take.

Each enemy will shoot randomly, and the difficulty (which will later be escaleted with each level) is defined by how often they randomly shoot.\nThe enemy beam is rather similar to the player’s beam. We will again make a very similar enemyBeam.js file with nearly the same code as the playerBeam.js but with different variable names and numbers:\nWe will share sprite and animation for the player\u0026rsquo;s beams and enemy\u0026rsquo;s beams. However, during implementation, you will create a separate group for enemyProjectiles:\nwe also need to create a difficulty for this game.(we will explain more about difficulty later, but for now, difficulty make sure enemy will shoot):\n we recommend setting difficulty to 1000. if set difficulty to 1000, the random number will pick from 1 to 1000. Only if the random number is 1, the enemy will shoot. The enemy will shoot continously if you try difficulty to 1. \n To make the enemies shoot randomly, we will first create an enemyShoot() method:\nand call it in the update() method:\nthat creates a new enemy projectile at a specified random rate.\nThen, we need to update enemy projectiles. We need to make sure each beam is deleted.\nyou will have to update enemy beams in enemyBeam.js like you did in playerBeam.js:\nalso update each enemyProjectile in scene 2, this is also similar to the projectiles\u0026rsquo; update:\nIn the end, it gameplay should look something like this: "},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/java-tictactoe/answer-key/","title":"Java: TicTacToe - Answer Key","tags":[],"description":"","content":"activity-1: Game SetUp public class TicTacToe_Nuevo { public static void main(String args[]){ // the board that stores moves  String[] board = {\u0026#34; \u0026#34;, \u0026#34; \u0026#34;, \u0026#34; \u0026#34;, \u0026#34; \u0026#34;, \u0026#34; \u0026#34;, \u0026#34; \u0026#34;, \u0026#34; \u0026#34;, \u0026#34; \u0026#34;, \u0026#34; \u0026#34;}; // starting board that labeled position(only printed once)  String[] startBoard = {\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;4\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;5\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;6\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;7\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;8\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;9\u0026#34;}; System.out.println(\u0026#34;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;~ Tic Tac Toe ~\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\\n* Choose number 1 - 9 to place your move\\n* Player: \u0026#39;X\u0026#39; Computer: \u0026#39;O\u0026#39;\\n\u0026#34; ); printBoard(startBoard); System.out.print(\u0026#34;Enter your move (1-9): \u0026#34;); } // method that prints the board with the board input  public static void printBoard(String[] curBoard){ System.out.println(\u0026#34; \u0026#34; + curBoard[0] + \u0026#34; | \u0026#34; + curBoard[1] + \u0026#34; | \u0026#34; + curBoard[2] + \u0026#34; \u0026#34;); System.out.println(\u0026#34;---+---+---\u0026#34;); System.out.println(\u0026#34; \u0026#34; + curBoard[3] + \u0026#34; | \u0026#34; + curBoard[4] + \u0026#34; | \u0026#34; + curBoard[5] + \u0026#34; \u0026#34;); System.out.println(\u0026#34;---+---+---\u0026#34;); System.out.println(\u0026#34; \u0026#34; + curBoard[6] + \u0026#34; | \u0026#34; + curBoard[7] + \u0026#34; | \u0026#34; + curBoard[8] + \u0026#34; \u0026#34;); } } activity-2: Read + Process Input import java.util.Scanner; public class TicTacToe_Nuevo { public static void main(String args[]){ Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); /*String[] board = {\u0026#34; \u0026#34;, \u0026#34; \u0026#34;, \u0026#34; \u0026#34;, \u0026#34; \u0026#34;, \u0026#34; \u0026#34;, \u0026#34; \u0026#34;, \u0026#34; \u0026#34;, \u0026#34; \u0026#34;, \u0026#34; \u0026#34;}; String[] startBoard = {\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;4\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;5\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;6\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;7\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;8\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;9\u0026#34;}; System.out.println(\u0026#34;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;~ Tic Tac Toe ~\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\\n* Choose number 1 - 9 to place your move\\n* Player: \u0026#39;X\u0026#39; Computer: \u0026#39;O\u0026#39;\\n\u0026#34;); printBoard(startBoard); System.out.print(\u0026#34;Enter your move (1-9): \u0026#34;); */ while(true){ int move; if(sc.hasNextInt()) { // get integer input \tmove = sc.nextInt(); // check if the integer is between 1, 9. check if the position is empty \tif (!(move \u0026gt; 0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; move \u0026lt;= 9) || !

The easiest one to implement is the score. Create a text variable on the top left of the screen that displays Score:  and the value of a num variable that stores the player\u0026rsquo;s score.\nthis.scoreText = this.add.text(20, 10, \u0026#34;Score: \u0026#34; + this.score, { font: \u0026#34;25px Arial\u0026#34;, fill: \u0026#34;white\u0026#34; }); this line print score variable at the top left of the screen.\n 20 and 10 is the x and y value \u0026quot;score\u0026quot; + this.score is the text value \n you can fill this line to this location after you create score value:\nJust add a score variable and some text to the screen that displays \u0026ldquo;Score: \u0026lsquo;score variable\u0026rsquo;\u0026quot;. We will update the hitEnemy() function so that the player will earn points to their score if they defeat an enemy:\nNow we will add levels. We will initialize it the same way we did for the score, but this time we will print it to the middle of the screen instead of the top left:\nWe will make levels pretty simple: whenever the player destroys all of the enemies, the next level will be reached, respawning all of the enemies. In order to make each level more difficult than the last, we will make the enemies shoot more often. To make the enemies shoot more often, let’s create a difficulty variable and use that when we make the enemies randomly shoot.\nWith this setup, by changing the difficulty variable, we change how often the enemies shoot. A lower difficulty will make the game harder because it will make the probability that an enemy shoots harder.\nNow to make the level update when the player destroys all of the enemies, we will create a levelClear() method that will update the difficulty variable, reset the enemytimer, create new enemies (by calling createEnemies()), and update the level text on screen :\nNote how we have to create a new timer every time we create new enemies or else the enemies and timer might not be in sync. Also, we recommend decrementing the difficulty variable less when we reach 200 because the difficulty ramps up much quicker at that point.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forgot to update levelClear() in update():\nNow, we will add lives. We will again use a similar method to initialize it and put it on the top right of the screen:\nNow, in order to lose a life whenever you get hit, now let’s add this code to hurtPlayer():\nHowever, in order for the lives to mean anything, let’s make it a Game Over when the player. We will start by making some text that’s invisible on the screen in the create() method:\nWe will make this text visible when it is a game over. We will do this in the hurtPlayer() method:\nThis makes the character not spawn, show the game over text, and restart the game if the player clicks on the screen.\nOnly thing now is that we need to create the restart() method that this code refers to:\nThis resets everything to start the game over\n"},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/csharp-guess-the-word/while-loops/","title":"While loops","tags":[],"description":"","content":"While loops while loops are an easy way to repeat the execution of lines without having to reuse a line many times. For example, to print Hello World five times in a row, you can do:\nvar counter = 1; while (counter \u0026lt;= 5) { Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34;); counter = counter + 1; } Like an if statement, inside the () beside while, you should specify a boolean expression. If the expression is true, the code inside the curly braces { } is executed. However, after everything inside the curly braces is executed, we go back to the top of the while loop and check the boolean expression again. If the boolean expression continues to be true, the loop will be repeated.\nYou can also place if statements in while loops to do some interesting behavior:\nvar counter = 1; while (counter \u0026lt;= 10) { if (counter \u0026lt; 5) { Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Smaller than 5!\u0026#34;); } else { Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Greater than or equal to 5!\u0026#34;); } counter = counter + 1; } Here is an example of an infinite loop - do you see what\u0026rsquo;s wrong?

To do this, go on the left side of repl.it, find the cube (\u0026lsquo;packages\u0026rsquo;) and search for Pillow 7.1.2 and click the + icon. This should automatically kick off installation. When done, try running the import statements below.\nThe activities below are already described in the curriculum with the example answers. Repeated here for ease of access.\nActivity 1: Open an Image The student can pick any image they want as long as it is appropriate.\n Find a picture student likes. Download it Save as JPG/PNG with easy name Upload this as another file in the repl.it window  from PIL import Image from PIL import ImageFilter image = Image.open(\u0026#34;cat.png\u0026#34;) image.save(\u0026#34;myCat.png\u0026#34;) The image.save() function allows the student to see the image that they uploaded. They will see a new file on the left pop up with the image (ie. in this example, \u0026lsquo;myCat.png\u0026rsquo;).\nActivity 2: Rotate the Image Rotate the image upside down example:\nfrom PIL import Image from PIL import ImageFilter image = Image.open(\u0026#34;cat.jpg\u0026#34;) image = image.rotate(180) image.save(\u0026#34;myCat.jpg\u0026#34;) Activity 3: Image Filters Add to existing code.\nfrom PIL import Image from PIL import ImageFilter # Activity 2 image = Image.open(\u0026#34;cat.jpg\u0026#34;) image = image.rotate(180) image.save(\u0026#34;myCat.jpg\u0026#34;) # Activity 3 blurredImage = image.filter(ImageFilter.BLUR) blurredImage.save(\u0026#34;myCatBlurred.jpg\u0026#34;) greyscaleImage = blurredImage.convert(\u0026#34;L\u0026#34;) greyscaleImage.save(\u0026#34;myCatBW.jpg\u0026#34;) Activity 4: from PIL import Image from PIL import ImageFilter from PIL import ImageDraw # add this line # Activity 2 image = Image.open(\u0026#34;cat.jpg\u0026#34;) image = image.rotate(180) image.save(\u0026#34;myCat.jpg\u0026#34;) # Activity 3 blurredImage = image.filter(ImageFilter.BLUR) blurredImage.save(\u0026#34;myCatBlurred.jpg\u0026#34;) greyscaleImage = blurredImage.convert(\u0026#34;L\u0026#34;) greyscaleImage.save(\u0026#34;myCatBW.jpg\u0026#34;) # Activity 4 drawnImage = ImageDraw.Draw(greyscaleImage) drawnImage.text((200,20), \u0026#34;When you realize you learned python in an hour.\u0026#34;) greyscaleImage.save(\u0026#34;myCatWithText.jpg\u0026#34;) "},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/csharp-guess-the-word/answer-key/","title":"Answer Key - C# Guess the Word","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Activity 1: using System; class MainClass { public static void Main(string[] args) { Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Hello there\u0026#34;); Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;I am awesome\u0026#34;); } } Activity 2: using System; class MainClass { public static void Main(string[] args) { Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Nuevo\u0026#34; + \u0026#34; \u0026#34; + \u0026#34;Foundation\u0026#34;); Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Nue\u0026#34; + \u0026#34;vo \u0026#34; + \u0026#34;Foundation\u0026#34;); Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Nuevo \u0026#34; + \u0026#34;Foun\u0026#34; + \u0026#34;dation\u0026#34;); } } Activity 3: class MainClass { public static void Main(string[] args) { Console.WriteLine(2-19); Console.WriteLine((3+5)*6); Console.WriteLine((13+5*8)/(6-(3+7))); } } Activity 4: class MainClass { public static void Main(string[] args) { Console.WriteLine(54 \u0026lt; (10 + 32)); Console.WriteLine((37 / 5) == 7 ); Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34; + \u0026#34;World\u0026#34; == \u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34;); Console.WriteLine(false == false); Console.WriteLine((11 - 2 \u0026lt; 10) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (7 + 3 \u0026gt; 10)); Console.WriteLine((true || 3 \u0026lt; 1) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (false || 3 \u0026gt; 1)); } } Activity 5: using System; class MainClass { public static void Main(string[] args) { var comp = \u0026#34;Computer\u0026#34;; var five = 5;\tConsole.WriteLine(comp); Console.WriteLine(five); Console.WriteLine(comp + comp); Console.WriteLine(five + five); Console.WriteLine(comp + comp + comp); Console.WriteLine(five + five + five); } } Activity 6: using System; class MainClass { public static void Main(string[] args) { Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Welcome!\u0026#34;); Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;How can I help you today?\u0026#34;); var input = Console.ReadLine(); Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;You asked: \u0026#34; + input); Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;I don’t know the answer to that!

For example, you can rotate your image and make it black and white. Ever wondered how these apps do it? The answer is using code!\nToday, we’re going to learn how to do some image manipulations using Python!\nSetting up the project To get started let’s start with importing a module. What does that mean? To do fun stuff with images, we need to unlock some functions to use. To get these functions we need to import a module. In this case if we import the module Pillow, we can use some functions that will help us modify images.\nFirstly, let’s delete everything in the main.py file. Then, add the following statements:\n from PIL import Image from PIL import ImageFilter  Once you hit run, you should see the module being installed in the console:\nIf you see the above, it means you have successfully imported a module! If you’re hitting issues, please ask for help before moving on.\nIf you’re curious to see what functions there are in the Pillow Image module, you find information about it here: https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/handbook/index.html\n "},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/image-manipulation/open-image/","title":"Open an image","tags":[],"description":"","content":"To change an image, we must open an image. We can use the Pillow Image module we just imported in the setup. Let’s first find some images to open. Find an image of your choice and download it. Once you have downloaded it, navigate back to your repl.it window and upload your image by clicking on the three dots and selecting ‘upload file’.\nFor example, to upload the cat.jpg file:\nYou should see the JPG file on the left side once you’ve uploaded it. Note, your image may have a different extension.\nNext step is to open that image within code. There are functions within the Pillow Image module we imported that allow us to do this.\nTo open and show the image you downloaded, do the following:\n image = Image.open(\"cat.jpg\") image.save(\"myCat.jpg\")  If you are using a different image, then make sure you put the name of the file within the quotes. The code above opens the JPG image and stores that image in the variable image. To check that the image variable has the image, we can then save it as a new image. This way the image will show in the window.\nHit run and see your image appear!

To do that, let’s look at the Pillow Image function rotate().\nThe rotate image works using angles. For example, rotate(45) will tilt your picture sideways by 45 degrees. Using rotate(90) will turn your picture sideways.\nLet’s give that a try! Let’s rotate the image before we save it:\n image = Image.open(\"cat.jpg\") image.rotate(90) image.save(\"myCat.jpg\")  Hmm, the picture didn’t seem to rotate. Why? Well, the image we opened is saved in the image variable. When we rotate the picture, we don’t save the rotated picture in any variable, so our code doesn’t save the rotated image.\nLet’s do this instead:\n image = Image.open(\"cat.jpg\") image = image.rotate(90) image.save(\"myCat.jpg\")  Challenge Can you turn this image all the way around?

Let\u0026rsquo;s do this by using the Pillow ImageFilter function filter() \u0026amp; convert().\nTo use the filter() function, you can specify the ImageFilter type within the parentheses. For example, image.filter(ImageFilter.BLUR)  will make the image blurry. Or, if you use ImageFilter.CONTOUR instead, it will add a ‘sketch’ type effect to your image.\nAdd something like this below your previously added code\n blurredImage = image.filter(ImageFilter.BLUR) blurredImage.save(\"myCatBlurred.jpg\")  You should see the saved cat image is blurred. Try this with a few other image filters until you find one you like!\nMy blurred and rotated image now looks like this: Next, I want to make my image black and white. To do this, we can use the convert() function. To use this function, you can specify the mode you want to convert your image to. The most common ones are \u0026ldquo;L\u0026rdquo;, which converts an image to greyscale, and “RGB” which converts an image to its true color.\nLet’s try it out like this:\n greyscaleImage = image.convert(\"L\") greyscaleImage.save(\"myCatBW.jpg\")  My cat now looks something like this – purrfect!

We can do that by utilizing the Pillow ImageDraw module. Let’s import that at the top of our file along with our other import statements.\n from PIL import Image from PIL import ImageFilter from PIL import ImageDraw  To allow us to add text, we must redraw the same image we used earlier for image manipulation. Let’s do that using the draw() function, which takes in an image object. Once the image is drawn, we can then add text to it by using the text() method to set the text of the image. The text is drawn based on coordinates provided. The function takes in two mandatory parameters: the xy coordinates and the text needed.\nFor example:\n drawnImage = ImageDraw.Draw(greyscaleImage) drawnImage.text((200,20), \"When you realize you learned python in an hour.\") greyscaleImage.save(\"myCatWithText.jpg\")  My image now looks like this: Challenge You can see that the text in the image created above is in a small, default font.

Instead of choosing what to show like IN(), NOT IN() will show all the columns you did not choose inside the parenthesis.\n  You can use commas inside the parenthesis to choose more than one column to show or not show.\n  Using only 1 input inside IN() is equivalent to using =:\n  Ex. column_name IN('obejct_in_column'); is the same as column_name = 'obejct_in_column';\n Now use what you learned!
