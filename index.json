We will add code to the below repl.it window, and we will do this in two parts.\n First, we need tell the turtle what color we want the line to be. To do this, let\u0026rsquo;s type in:\nturtle.color(\u0026quot;orange\u0026quot;)  Let\u0026rsquo;s try to understand this line of code in more detail.\nStrings Anything you see in quotation marks is called a string. A string is just a sequence of characters (whether they are letters, numbers, or symbols).\nIn the code above, \u0026quot;orange\u0026quot; is a string. Other examples of strings include \u0026quot;123\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;abc!\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;green\u0026quot;. Be careful, 123, abc! and green are not strings because there are missing quotation marks!\nMethods turtle.color() is a method. We use methods to get the turtle to perform certain actions. In this case, turtle.color() is changing the color of the lines it draws to what color we tell it to. We told it to change the color to orange by sending it the string \u0026quot;orange\u0026quot; as an argument.\nArguments Arguments are inputs that you pass in to methods to use. In our example, turtle.color() needs a string argument representing the name of the color to set the turtle, so we passed in \u0026quot;orange\u0026quot; as an argument to the method. We could also have told it to change the color to something else, but it has to have been a color that turtle.color() understands. The colors that it recognizes are: \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;orange\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;yellow\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;green\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;purple\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pink\u0026quot;, and \u0026quot;gray\u0026quot;. If we send in anything else besides one of these color strings, we get the default color, which is black.\n Now that we have picked the color that we want, we can now draw a line! To draw a line there are two methods that we can use:\nturtle.forward(50) turtle.backward(50)  turtle.forward(50) will make the turtle go forward 50 pixels and draw a line in the direction it\u0026rsquo;s facing, while turtle.backward(50) will do the same, but in the opposite direction.\nPixels An image is composed of thousands, if not, millions of pixels. A pixel is a unit of measurement for digital images, similar to how we measure weight in pounds, or long distances in miles.\nIntegers An integer is just any whole number, whether positive or negative. In this example, both turtle.forward() and turtle.backward() expect an integer as an argument instead of a string. This is because the argument represents the number of pixels you want the turtle to move when drawing. A string would clearly not work for these methods!\n Let\u0026rsquo;s make the turtle go forward, so type in turtle.forward(50). Now your code should look something like this:\nimport turtle turtle.color(\u0026quot;orange\u0026quot;) turtle.forward(50)  Now that we have completed our code, press run. You should see the following in the result screen:\nIf so, great! If not, please ask for help.\nAs an exercise, try understanding what the following line of code does, and try adding this to your code. What does it do?\nturtle.shape(\u0026quot;turtle\u0026quot;)  HELP! Nothing shows up on the screen! If, after pressing run, you don\u0026rsquo;t see anything on the screen, check to see if there is a red x beside the console tab (the console tab is right beside the result tab in the middle of the screen).

Make sure that that none of the lines you have written so far start with any spaces.

A few things about music. What is Music? Music is the chronological organisation of sounds; that is, making certain sounds at certain times, which make melodic, rhythmic and harmonic sense. The first, most basic concept, is keeping the sounds \u0026ldquo;in time\u0026rdquo;. This leads us to some of the first few musical concepts: beat, rhythm, duration \u0026amp; tempo.\n Beat is the regular pulse which provides a timeline for the rhythm to anchor itself to. Rhythm is essentially repeated patterns of long or short, stressed or unstressed sounds or silences which fit into the main beat. Duration is the length of notes or sounds or silences which facilitate the rhythm. Tempo is the speed at which a piece of music is played.

The image below outlines the structure of a basic webpage.

Rather than having to constantly type out the same code, we can put the desired code in a method and call it whenever we want to use it.\nNote: The purpose of a function is to help reduce redundant code throughout the program.\nCreating a function - Function declaration \u0026amp; definition Declaration: To make a function in python, we must use the def keyword. This keyword tells the code editor where the function is defined. def is followed by the name of the function. In order to generalize the function (so that we can use it at multiple places), we might need to send some information to it. This is achieved using parameters. They are placed in between parentheses () and follows right after the name of the function. If no parameters are needed, they can be ignored. The function declaration ends with a colon. Here\u0026rsquo;s what a function looks like:\nWarning: Make sure that the first line of your function always ends with a colon :\nDefinition: In Python, indentation defines which code is controlled by the function. For example, look at the following image: The code that is indented underneath the sectionA function is the code that is executed each time function sectionA is called.\nWarning: Since identation is very important in Python, make sure that the body of the function always starts with 2 spaces.\nUsing the function - Function call To call a function, input the name of the function and its parameters wherever you want to execute the function. For example, in order to call function sectionA, we would do something like this: Be careful: When making a function in Python, you must define the function and its contents before it is called. In other words, in the code, you need to put the function declaration above the function call. Otherwise, you will receive a NameError like below. See the following figure for an example: Challenge - Create your own function! Challenge: Create a function called addNumbers that takes 2 parameters called number1 \u0026amp; number2 and prints the sum on console. Call the function addNumbers with parameters 3 \u0026amp; 5.

Wouldn’t it be great if we can give instructions once and tell the program to repeat it 4 times? Fear not, we can!\nTo do this, we need to use loops. Loops run a set of instructions multiple times. To see this in action, here is some example code that draws a triangle:\nfor i in range(3): turtle.forward(50) turtle.left(120)  Let’s understand what this code does. for i in range(3): This statement tells the program to run the instructions in a loop. range(3) sets a limit to how many times the loop runs (in this case, 3 times).

It is used to keep track of how many times we have run the contents of the loop.\nTricky Python syntax - Part 1 Syntax is how we write languages so that it is understandable.

Starting Up Open your favorite internet browser (such as Edge, Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer) and go to https://repl.it. Scroll to the bottom of the page, look for ‘languages’, search for Python and click it.\nYou should see something like the following screen:\nWe will ignore some of the details on this screen, but we will go over some of the basics that show up. The main.py file contains code, or instructions for the computer to run. Anything that results from running the code will be displayed on the right side. This window is called the console.\nWriting to Console (Printing) Let’s start by doing a print statement. A print statement allows you to take control of the computer and make it print something out!\nTo start, copy and paste this text in your Repl.it window:\nprint(\u0026ldquo;HelloWorld!\u0026rdquo;)\nHit run and watch your console say ”Hello, World!” on the screen to the right! print tells the computer to print the sentence within the parentheses () into the console, or the screen on the right. Note: The RUN buttom looks like this: HELP! I got a lot of red text!\nIf you see any red text, you have encountered some errors! Please ask for help or check the debugging page at the end of this tutorial. In particular, beware of the following when coding in Python:\n Make sure the sentence you wish to print is surrounded in quotation marks and that the sentence is inside the parentheses.  Spacing in Python is very important. Make sure you don’t have any unnecessary spaces or tabs at the beginning or at the end of each line, as Python won’t be able to read the code otherwise. For example, don’t put any spaces before print, or any spaces after the last parenthesis in print(\u0026ldquo;Hello, World!).  Activity 1  Without removing the quotation marks, try changing \u0026ldquo;Hello, World\u0026rdquo; to another sentence. (For example – \u0026ldquo;My name is Nuvi!\u0026rdquo;) Press run to see if anything changes. Add another print below the current line to print a second sentence below the first sentence. Press run to see if two sentences are printed out.  We will use printing a lot in the later lessons, so make sure you understand this before continuing!  Comments If at any time during this activity, you wish to write notes to help you understand the code, you can use the # symbol to create a comment. Any text after the # symbol will be ignored by the computer. Try adding a comment above your first line of code and press run. You will see that the computer will ignore your comment.\n#This is my first line of code print(\u0026ldquo;Hello,world!) Be careful, if you remove the # symbol, your code will not work! The Basics Strings Anything that is surrounded by quotation marks is called a string. This is how a computer represents words or sentences. For example, \u0026ldquo;a\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;2\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;banana!\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;Hello World\u0026rdquo; are strings, but 2 and Hello World are not strings, because the quotation marks are missing.\nYou can combine many strings together using the + sign.\nFor example:\n \u0026ldquo;Apple\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;Pineapple\u0026rdquo; produces the string \u0026ldquo;ApplePineapple\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;Nuevo\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo; \u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;Foundation\u0026rdquo; produces the string \u0026ldquo;Nuevo Foundation\u0026rdquo;.  What if you wanted to combine your first and last name? How would you do that?\nActivity 2 Delete all the print statements in your code. Start your code with the line print(\u0026ldquo;Nuevo\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo; \u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;Foundation\u0026rdquo;)\nIf you run it, you should get the following output:\nNuevo Foundation  Let’s try and find two more ways to print the string \u0026ldquo;Nuevo Foundation\u0026rdquo; using two plus (+) symbols in each print statement. Once you make this work, you should have \u0026ldquo;Nuevo Foundation\u0026rdquo; printed out 3 times. In other words, your console should look like this after you press run: Nuevo Foundation Nuevo Foundation Nuevo Foundation\nHint: The strings that you combine do not have to be real words! For example, \"Ap\" + \"ple\" will produce the string \"Apple\". Ask for help if you are confused  Variables Variables are simply names that we can give to values such as strings, numbers, and booleans. Here’s how to make a variable named s. We say s is a string that has the value \u0026ldquo;Hello, World!\u0026rdquo;. Can you describe the following variables?\ns = \u0026quot;Hello, World!\u0026quot; x = 88 happy = True  Press run.\nNote that variables are not printed out to the console. Instead, the variable simply saves the string, number, or boolean into the computer’s memory. We can use these variables in other statements. For example, the following code would print \u0026ldquo;Hello Nuevo Foundation\u0026rdquo; to the console:\nstr1 = \u0026quot;Hello\u0026quot; str2 = \u0026quot;Nuevo Foundation\u0026quot; print(str1 + \u0026quot; \u0026quot; + str2)  You can also do the following to print strings together while adding spaces in between the words.\nstr1 = \u0026quot;Hello\u0026quot; str2 = \u0026quot;Nuevo Foundation\u0026quot; print(str1, str2)  Activity 3  Create two new variables: A variable named comp that stores the string \u0026ldquo;Computer\u0026rdquo;. A variable named five that stores the number 5.  Next, use the variables and what you learned in the previous activities to print out the following to the console. You must use the variables!\nComputer 5 ComputerComputer 10 ComputerComputerComputer 15  Hint: If you’re stuck, consider using the + operator. Remember that you can use the variables comp and **five** multiple times in the same line!  Reading from the Console Now that we know the basics about variables, we can ask for input from the user. Use the following line to tell our program to wait until the user types something into the console. Then, the computer takes whatever is typed into the console, and stores it into the variable called value. value = input()\nHere’s an example of how to use input() to accept user input:\nprint(\u0026quot;What's your name?\u0026quot;) value = input() print(\u0026quot;Hello \u0026quot; + value + \u0026quot;!\u0026quot;)  Give this a try! When you hit run, you’ll notice that the doesn’t appear on the console yet. See below.\nThis is because the program is waiting for you to type something in. Enter your name or ‘Nuvi’ into the console on the right, press Enter, and check that it prints out correctly. Note: Even if we type in a number, such as 8, the variable value will contain the string \"8\". Be careful when attempting to do math on input variables!  Activity 4 Let’s see if we can write a program that first prints the following two lines to console:\nWelcome! How can I help you today?  Afterwards, the console waits for user input. After the user types something in the console and presses Enter, the computer prints out:\nYou asked: [input]? I don’t know the answer to [input]. Goodbye!  [input] should be replaced with whatever the user had typed into the console. For example, if you wanted to ask “How old am I?”, the computer will print out that it doesn’t know the answer to that.\nHint: This is very similar to the example that we went through together above. Try making some small changes from what we have already given you.  Conditional Statements Now that we know the basics of print statements, variables, and reading in input from the user – we can combine all these awesome skills with conditional statements. Conditional statements allow the computer to make decisions based off the value of an expression. In the real world, we use conditional statements all the time to make decisions! For example, if it is raining outside, then I use an umbrella. In this example, the I evaluated the weather outside and because it was raining, I made the sequential decision to use an umbrella.\nWhat conditional statements can you think of that you use in everyday life?\nIf-Statements We’ll start off with an if statement in its simplest form!\nShown above we have three different parts:\n If – this tells the computer that we are going to deciding based off the expression inside the parenthesis Expr – this represents the expression that we are evaluating. If the expression is “truthful” then the computer will enter the if statement and execute the statement. Statement – what the computer will complete if the expression is “truthful”  Let’s break down the example above and decide why some statements are “truthful” or “falsy”.\nWe are given to variables “x” and “y” are they are assigned two values. In the first if statement we are testing if the value of x is less than the value of y. Since 0 is less than 5, this is true! So, the first if- statement will print yes.\nHowever, we can see that y is not less than x, so it evaluates to false. The inside of the if statement will not be executed then. The same applies for the if statement evaluating if x is equal to 10. We see that x is equal to 0, so this expression is false, and the inside of the if statement won’t be executed.\nElse - Statements Now that we know how to use if statements to conditionally execute a single statement or multiple statements, let’s see what else we can do!\nSometimes, you need to evaluate a condition in order to act accordingly if it is true, but if it false we act differently. Here is the simplest form of the else statement.\nThis is really like the if statement! However here, if the if statement is false (not truthful) the program will automatically execute the statment2 in the else statement. A real-life example is if I’m hungry, I’ll eat. But if I’m not hungry, I won’t eat. Let’s take a look in python code!\nActivity 5 Let’s put it all together! Let’s see if we can create a program that takes prompts the user for their name. The user can write their name into the console. Then the computer can decide if their name is equal to your name, print out a response. Else, print out a different response!\n Hint: Try talking out the different paths to a computer can take! Make sure to identify what the if and else conditions are.  Part 3 - Time to Create Overview It’s time to start creating our own stories with all the skills we’ve learned today! The question that we are tackling today is how to get the audience involved with the story line, and the answer to this is CODE!\nSection 1: Story Boarding To get started, pull out a piece a paper and start “story boarding”. What does that mean? In order to develop a great story that allows the reader to choose between options, one can outline the flow of their story. This is a great planning step, that will you help you tremendously once you start coding! I would start with the 3 or 4 main choices your protagonist is going to make in the story. From there draw arrows for how the different choices your protagonist makes effects the story.\nNuevo’s Example Here an example of how to story board! The 4 main choices the protagonist will make is:\n Will she walk home from Robotics practice? Will she ride a bicycle home from Robotics practice? Will she play soccer with her friends at home? Will she go swimming with her friends at home?  Here is the resulting story board:\nNow, it’s great to mark up the different section of story board to match with different coding concepts that we’ve learned. If our story needs to make decision, our code we use if-else statements. If we are asking the audience to give us input to make decisions in our story, we will use user input. The actual story that the audience will be reading is string variables!\nLet’s mark it up on the story board! Here is what it looks like:\nIt’s really helpful to annotate your story board so you know what code related topics we can use! We see that the story line will be comprised off text or string variables. The user-input can be the reader typing whether they want to “walk” or “bike” or choose “soccer” or “swim”. The user can choose their story based off the input they give to the computer! The different paths that Nuevo can take are a series of decisions. Luckily, we learned how to use if – else statements, so the Nuevo can easily choose different paths the story can take!\nSection 2: Transferring the Story Board to Code! It’s time to open repl.it. Now it is time to create, let’s get creative!\nYou can continue working off Nuevo’s story line: \nYou can work on a template for a Choose Your Own Adventure game: \nOr you can start from scratch and make it your own! Just go to repl.it and start story telling!\n"},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-earsketch/4-getting-started-earsketch/","title":"Getting started with Earsketch","tags":[],"description":"intro on how to use Earsketch","content":"EarSketch is a free educational programming environment developed at Georgia Institute of Technology.

We will be placing our new code between the setTempo() and finish() functions. The setTempo() function allows you to set the overall project tempo.\nQuick Fact: Tempo is the speed at which a piece of music is played. Changing a project\u0026rsquo;s tempo allows for different styles of music to be created. Try changing the tempo of your setTempo function and see what happens! Please make sure it is a number between 45-220.   Now that our tempo is set, it is time to add sounds. To do so, we must utilize the fitMedia() function.

But we also need to tell it how to display the elements, and where to place them. We may want the title on the center or on the right side. We may want a picture on the right and a paragraph on the left. There are two ways we can do this: through HTML attributes or Cascading Style Sheets.\nCascading Style Sheets (CSS) HTML attributes are straight-forward but they can become messy quickly. If we wish to do a lot of styling, each HTML element can become long and hard to read. Furthermore, what if we want to style many elements the same way? We would have to copy all the attributes for each element, which is not efficient and prone to mistakes. For most styling, it’s better to use CSS.\nCSS files work closely with HTML tags. Each HTML tag can have a class attribute and/or an id attribute that helps to identify each element. Many elements can have the same class, and an element can have multiple classes. However, an element can only have one single id, and the id cannot be shared among elements. The CSS file uses these attributes to display styling specific to each class or id.\nSee this example below: See the Pen Styling it up by Deliana Escobari (@Sunny-Dee) on CodePen.\n Click the \u0026ldquo;HTML\u0026rdquo; tab on the top left corner to see the HTML code, and the \u0026ldquo;CSS\u0026rdquo; tab to see the CSS code.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take a look at the HTML code. Try to find a \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; tag with the attribute \u0026ldquo;info\u0026rdquo;. It looks like \u0026lt;div id=\u0026ldquo;info\u0026rdquo;\u0026gt;. By giving this div an id, we can then use CSS to specify styling for this specific element.\nSwitch over to the CSS file. We can also give styling to all elements of a specific type - for example, we could use CSS give all \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; elements the same style. In the header block, we tell the browser to color all the headers #0097A7 (which is the teal color).\nLet\u0026rsquo;s talk about the syntax (or the way of writing) for CSS. First, you start with what element you want to style. If you want to style all elements with the same tag (such as \u0026lt;header\u0026gt;), simply write the name. If you want to style an element with a class or id, put a . or a # in front of the class or id name respectively. Then, for each property you wish to change, use the format attribute-name: value;. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to end each line with a ;. All these styles should be surrounded by the curly braces { and }.\nThere are way too many style elements to cover them all in this tutorial. If, in the sketch you made earlier, you aren\u0026rsquo;t sure how to use CSS to accomplish the desired styling, try searching online.\nWhile CSS understands 140 color names such as \"green\", \"red\", and \"blue\", this can still be limiting. What about if we want a dark green, or a slightly lighter green? To achieve this, we can also refer to colors in hexadecimal or RGB form. Check this link to see the colors and their corresponding hexadecimal form.\n Adding a new font  Let\u0026rsquo;s import the Heebo font from the internet. First we import the font at the top of the CSS file with this statement: @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Heebo|Open+Sans'); Then we assigned it to the body tag. Since this tag will contain all the other HTML elements, our choice of font will be used for all elements.   Notice that the format inside the curly braces is: name: value;\n @import url(\u0026lsquo;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto+Mono'); \nfont-family: 'Roboto Mono', monospace; @import url(\u0026lsquo;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Indie+Flower');\nfont-family: 'Indie Flower', cursive; @import url(\u0026lsquo;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Pacifico'); \nfont-family: 'Pacifico', cursive; @import url(\u0026lsquo;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Permanent+Marker');\nfont-family: 'Permanent Marker', cursive;   "},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-turtle/activity-4/","title":"Activity 4 - Simplifying code with functions","tags":[],"description":"","content":"We drew one hexagon. But this is just one of many hexagons Alex needs to build his honeycomb. Once again, it seems that we would have to repeat the code many times to draw multiple hexagons. Fortunately, we don\u0026rsquo;t have to! Functions to the rescue!\nFunctions A function is a way to group together lines of code to do something. For instance, turtle.forward(50) moves the turtle forward 50 steps, and turtle.left(120) turns the turtle left 120 degrees. What if we want to always do these two actions together? We can put them in a function called draw_line(), so that whenever this function is called, both of these actions take place simultaneously. Think of this like a recipe: we compile all the instructions together, and the recipe\u0026rsquo;s name is the food we are making.\n Here is an example of a function definition, and how we would use it:\ndef draw_line(): turtle.forward(50) turtle.left(120)  The first line is called the function definition header. The def keyword tells the computer that we are defining a new function. Next, we give the function a name, in this case draw_line. Finally, don\u0026rsquo;t forget the (): at the end of the line, which tells the computer that we are starting the function body.\nExtra material - parameters Inside the parentheses () we would normally define parameters for the function. Parameters are inputs that we can give into the function, which the function can use to produce its output. For example, we must have two numbers to add them together and produce a result - the two numbers we used can be considered parameters. Today, we will not use parameters, and leave it as ().\n Similar to a for-loop, anything that we wish to define within the function needs to be preceded by 1 tab.\nIf you press run with just this code, you will notice that you won\u0026rsquo;t see any output! We\u0026rsquo;ve only created the functions, but we need to use them. To use the function we created, type in draw_line() again, but without the def.\ndef draw_line(): # Function definition turtle.forward(50) turtle.left(120) draw_line() # Function call  This is called a function call for the draw_line() function. A function call runs the code that’s defined in the function with the same name. With the recipe analogy, think of it as actually performing the recipe.\nTips  Always make sure the names of your functions are descriptive enough to explain what the code in the function does. Your function call must be below the function definition. \n Tricky Python syntax - Part 2 Notice that functions use similar syntax rules with for-loops - you must have a : at the end of the function declaration, and anything in the function body needs to start with a tab.\nWhat happens when you need a for-loop inside of a function? Then, you need to combine the rules together! Here is an example on how to properly put a for-loop inside of a function.\ndef draw_line(): for i in range(3): turtle.forward(50)  Notice that turtle.forward(50) has 2 tabs in front of it, because it is both inside of a function definition, and inside of a for-loop!\n So, let’s try that out by making our own draw_hexagon() function! Remember to include the function definition header, the number of sides a hexagon has, and the angle associated with a hexagon: 60 degrees.\n "},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/csharp-guess-the-word/activity-2/","title":"Activity 2","tags":[],"description":"","content":" Activity 2 Find // TODO (ACTIVITY 2) in the GuessTheWord code.

Find an audio clip you would like to add to your current song and input it under the fileName parameter. The trackNumber parameter should be a unique number. This will allow us to place our sounds on different tracks. Having different sounds on different tracks allows us to maintain organization of our sounds and play different sounds at the same time.

Similar to how we used fitMedia() to add new audio clips, we must use the setEffect() function to define specific effects for each audio clip. It is important to note that multiple effects can be placed on the same track. This allows for the producer to combine multiple effects together. Earsketch has many effects built-in. To reference all the effects, visit this link\nBefore we start adding effects to our song, let\\\u0026rsquo;s breakdown the pieces of the two setEffect functions:  track: The track number to which the effect is applied to. Note: To apply an effect to the Master track, use 0 as the value for track. The master track is where all the audio is collectively played together. This is an easy way to apply an effect to all the sounds being processed. effectType: The specific effect being used effectParameter: The setting for the effect being used effectValue: The value applied to the effectParameter  This setEffect function is used to apply an effect to a specific track for the entire duration of the song, but what if you only want a specific section of your song to have an effect? Use the setEffect function with more parameters!  effectStartValue: The starting value applied to the parameter effectStartLocation: The measure at which the starting value is set effectEndValue: The ending value of the parameter effectEndLocation: The measure at which the ending value is set  This version of the setEffect allows for us to perform \\\u0026ldquo;automation\\\u0026rdquo; on a specific piece of our song. Automation is a way to change the value of an effect over time. One use of automation is to make a song fade in or fade out. To do so, we must adjust the GAIN effectParameter volume in the VOLUME effectType over time. For example, if we define our effectStartValue at -60 db and our effectEndValue at 0 db, it will sound like our song is fading in over time. To adjust the starting point and length of the effect, specify the effectStartLocation and effectEndLocation.\nAdd effects to your song Since we are more familiar with using effects, let\u0026rsquo;s add an effect to our song.\n On the API browser on the left, scroll to setEffect API. Insert a setEffect function call into your code, using the paste icon. We need to replace the parameters with our own values. Put an integer value for trackNumber. Let\u0026rsquo;s put 2. For the rest of the effect parameters, click on the eye icon on the setEffect API and you will see a link to \u0026ldquo;Every Effect Explained in Detail\u0026rdquo;. Click on it to open this section on the right side of your window. You may notice that Earsketch has many different variations of effects. By default, you should see section 30.4 BANDPASS on the right. For now, we will use the DELAY from section 30.4 as effectType in our setEffect function call. Now that we have chosen our effectType, we need an effectParameter. Navigate to section 30.4 on the right to check out different parameters supported for DELAY. Here is a picture of that section. We recommend using the DELAY_FEEDBACK.  For the final parameter, input a valid value. Since we have chosen DELAY_FEEDBACK, we must specify a number between -120.0 and -1.0 (as shown in the picture above). Example: Use -6.0 as your effect value for DELAY_FEEDBACK.  Your code should now look something like this: from earsketch import *\ninit() setTempo(120)\nfitMedia(HOUSE_DEEP_CRYSTALCHORD_001, 3, 1, 5) fitMedia(HOUSE_DEEP_CRYSTALCHORD_002, 3, 5, 9)\n# Section A def sectionA(startMeasure, endMeasure): fitMedia(RD_UK_HOUSEAIRYPAD_1, 1, startMeasure, endMeasure) fitMedia(HOUSE_MAIN_BEAT_002, 4, startMeasure, endMeasure) fitMedia(HOUSE_ROADS_BASS_001, 5, startMeasure, endMeasure)\n# Section B def sectionB(startMeasure, endMeasure): fitMedia(Y37_ORGAN_1, 2, startMeasure, endMeasure) fitMedia(HOUSE_ROADS_BASS_001, 5, startMeasure, endMeasure) fitMedia(RD_UK_HOUSEARPLEAD_1, 6, startMeasure, endMeasure)\nsectionA(1, 9) sectionB(9, 17) sectionA(17, 25) setEffect(2, DELAY, DELAY_FEEDBACK, -6.0) setEffect(2, DELAY, DELAY_TIME, 1200.0) setEffect(0, VOLUME, GAIN, -60, 1, 0, 3)\nfinish() \n\n"},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/web-basics/contact-form/","title":"Adding a Contact Form","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Finally, we will add a contact form to let people reach us if they are interested in Benji.\nMost browsers do not support sending emails directly from the contact form because it\u0026rsquo;s an easy way for trouble makers to send spam to users.

For example, combining red and blue together make purple. We can also change the amount of red and blue mixed together to create different shades of purple. The computer does something similar to produce colors. By combining various intensities of red, green, and blue, we can create different colors, such as powder blue, golden yellow, and salmon pink. Click here to see the colors and their corresponding hexadecimal form.\nIn the turtle.color() method, we can specify three integer arguments corresponding to the amount of red, green, and blue to mix. Each integer must be between 0 and 255 inclusive. One example can be turtle.color(30, 100, 238), which produces a dark shade of blue.\n Update your mandala flower to use a color of your liking.

This is a great time to use your knowledge of comments, numbers, variables, and reading from console to complete the 4 activities. Some background information for each activity is provided below, and hints are provided in the code. After each part, press run and make sure there are no errors present in the console.\nActivity 4.1 First, let\u0026rsquo;s introduce some more code into our game. Find the two lines of code which start with TODO (ACTIVITY 4.1) (one is at approximately line 60, and the other at approximately line 130). Delete both lines of code entirely. This unlocks the main behavior of the game, such as checking if the letter guessed by the player is found in the word to guess.\nUnfortunately, after pressing run, it seems like the game does not wait for user input, and continuously guesses 'C' instead! This is no good, so let\u0026rsquo;s fix this in the next part.\nActivity 4.2 When the player makes a guess, we need to take the guessed letter and store it in a variable. The variable will be used to check if the letter appears in the word to guess. Use Console.ReadLine to wait for user input and store the user input in the input variable. Note: we have already declared the variable input already, so you do not need to use the var keyword.\nTo check if you have done this correctly, press run, and you should now be able to type in a letter into the console.\nActivity 4.3 Every time a letter is guessed correctly, we need to increment (add one to) the number of correctly guessed letters. Use the lettersRevealed variable to change the number of correctly guessed letters. Press run to make sure no errors occur. We have also provided some code to print out the value of the lettersRevealed variable for testing purposes. Make sure to delete this when you are done testing, since this is something we do not want to reveal to the player!\nActivity 4.4 Every time a letter is guessed incorrectly, the player loses a life. Decrement (subtract one from) the number of lives, using the lives variable. We will also tell the player how many lives they have remaining, when they make an incorrect guess, by printing the number of lives to the console. Check if you have done this correctly by pressing run, guessing an incorrect letter, and seeing if the correct number of lives are displayed on the console.\nFun Fact - Bugs Recall in Activity 4.1 that after uncommenting some code, we experienced some unexpected behavior. Any problems or unexpected behaviors in the program are called \u0026ldquo;bugs\u0026rdquo;. We fixed the bug introduced in Activity 4.1 by introducing user input in Activity 4.2.\nEven if you implemented everything correctly in the previous parts, if you keep playing for a while, another issue still occurs.

We will fix this bug in Activity 6.\n "},{"uri":"https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/web-basics/in-case-youre-wondering/","title":"In case you were wondering","tags":[],"description":"","content":"You might be concerned about Benji, but we are happy to tell you that he found his home through a website just like the one you are building.

Here is an example:\nvar myNum = (93 + 41) / 12; if (myNum == 11) { Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;They are equal!\u0026#34;); }  Inside the () beside if, you should specify a boolean expression. If the expression is true, the code inside { } is executed. In this case, since myNum is equal to 11, They are equal! is printed.\nIf the condition is false, nothing happens! For example, since 10 is not greater than 11, Print me! will not show up to the console.\nvar happy = 10; if (happy \u0026gt; 11) { Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Print me!\u0026#34;); }  Use else to tell the computer what to do if the condition is false. In this example, now I got printed instead! will be printed to the console.\nvar happy = 10; if (happy \u0026gt; 11) { Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Print me!\u0026#34;); } else { Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;I got printed instead!\u0026#34;); }  You can chain many cases together using else if. Note that when using else if, only the first case will be evaluated. For example, in the following code snippet, Statement 1 will be printed. We will skip the check that sad == 4 and Statement 2 will not be printed, even though sad == 4 is true.\nvar sad = 4; if (sad \u0026lt; 9) { Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Statement 1\u0026#34;); } else if (sad == 4) { Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Statement 2\u0026#34;); } else { Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Statement 3\u0026#34;); }  You can also place if statements inside other if statements for some interesting behavior:\nvar num1 = 10; var num2 = 20; if (num1 \u0026lt; num2) { if (num2 \u0026lt; 30) { Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Hello!\u0026#34;); } else { Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Hola!\u0026#34;); } }  Working Together Let\u0026rsquo;s write a program that first prints the following line to console:\nIs coding fun?

If the user enters no, the computer prints out Oh no, that's too bad!. Otherwise, the computer prints out: I don't understand you! Goodbye!.    Fun Fact: Switch statements Using multiple if, else statements could get very long and confusing. You can use switch statements instead if you want to compare a single variable against multiple values. For example, the Working Together activity can be completed using the following piece of code:\nvar input = Console.ReadLine(); switch (input) { case \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34;: Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Yes, I\u0026#39;m glad you\u0026#39;re enjoying it!\u0026#34;); break; case \u0026#34;no\u0026#34;: Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Oh no, that\u0026#39;s too bad!\u0026#34;); break; default: Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;I don\u0026#39;t understand you!

Para hacerlo de color naranja (orange in inglés) esta es la instrucción:\nturtle.color(\u0026quot;orange\u0026quot;)  Intentemos entender esta línea de código en más detalle.\nCadenas (Strings) Todo lo que veas entre comillas \u0026ldquo;\u0026rdquo; se llama cadena o string. Un string es solo una secuencia de caracteres, es decir, de números, letras o símbolos.\nEn el código que escribimos arriba \u0026quot;orange\u0026quot; es un string. Otros ejemplos de string pueden ser \u0026quot;123\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;abc!\u0026quot; o \u0026quot;green\u0026quot;. ¡Ojo!, 123, abc! and green NO son strings ¡porque no tienen comillas!arks!\nMétodos turtle.color() es un método. Usamos los métodos para hacer que la tortuga haga ciertas acciones. En este caso, turtle.color() está cambiando el color con el que va a dibujar. Nosotros le dijimos que cambiara su color original por naranja (orange) cuando mandamos el string \u0026quot;orange\u0026quot; como un argument.\nArgumentos Los argumentos son los valores que le pasamos a los métodos. En nuestro ejemplo, turtle.color() necesita un argumento que represente el nombre del color que va a usar la tortuga, así que pasamos \u0026quot;orange\u0026quot; como un argument al método. Podríamos usar otro color pero tiene que ser un color que el método entienda. Los colores que reconoce son \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;orange\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;yellow\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;green\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;purple\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pink\u0026quot;, y \u0026quot;gray\u0026quot;. Si mandamos algún color diferente, el método no lo reconocerá y usará el color que tenía al inicio: negro.\n Ahora que ya escogimos el color que queremos, ¡ya podemos dibujar la línea! Para dibujar la línea tenemos dos métodos que podemos usar:\nturtle.forward(50) turtle.backward(50)  turtle.forward(50) hará que la tortuga se mueva hacia adelante 50 pixeles y dibujará la línea en esa dirección mientras que turtle.backward(50) hará lo mismo pero hacia atrás.\nPixeles Una imagen está compuesta por miles o millones de pixeles. Un pixel es una unidad de medida para las imagenes digitales. Imagínalo como cada uno de los pequeños puntos de los que está hecha una imagen.\nEnteros (Integers) Un integer es sólo un número, ya sea negativo o positivo. En nuestro ejemplo, tanto turtle.forward() como turtle.backward() necesitan un entero como argumento. Cuando escogimos el color necesitabamos un string pero esta vez necesitamos un entero. Esto es porque el argumento representa el número de pixeles que se moverá la tortuga en la dirección que le indicamos. No tendría sentido decirle que se mueva \u0026quot;orange\u0026quot; pixeles, ¿o sí?\nPara que la tortuga se mueva hacia adelante el código debería verse así:\nimport turtle turtle.color(\u0026quot;orange\u0026quot;) turtle.forward(50)  Copia las líneas de arriba, pégalas en el archivo main.py que teníamos al inicio, y da click en Run.\n Como ejercicio, trata de entender que hace la siguiente línea de código. Después pégala al final del archivo main.py y vuélvelo a correr.\nturtle.shape(\u0026quot;turtle\u0026quot;)  ¡AYUDA! No se ve nada en la pantalla Si, después de presionar el botón Run, no logras ver nada en la pestaña result, revisa si hay una x roja en la pestaña console. Si la ves, es porque tienes errores en el código. Pídele ayuda al instructor par revisar tu código.\nMientas tanto puedes revisar lo siguiente:\n No uses letras mayúsculas. Asegúrate que ninguna línea que hayas escrito tenga espacios al inicio. Revisa que el color que hayas escogido esté entre comillas y que esté entre os paréntesis del commando turtle.color().   Actividad 1 - Dibujando un cuadrado ¡Muy bien! Has ayudado a Alex a dibujar una línea. Ahora demos un paso más y dibujemos un cuadrado. Para dibujarlo, necesitamos seguir los siguientes pasos:\n Ir hacia adelante 50 pixeles. Girar a la izquierda 90 grados. Ir hacia adelante 50 pixeles. Girar a la izquierda 90 grados. Ir hacia adelante 50 pixeles. Girar a la izquierda 90 grados. Ir hacia adelante 50 pixeles.  Recuerda que debes usar turtle.forward() para dibujar líneas. Para girar 90 grados necesitas pasar 90 como argumento al método turtle.left():\nturtle.left(90)   Activity 2 - Simplificando el código con ciclos (loops) ¡Genial! Dibujaste un cuadrado. ¿Pero notas cómo estamos escribiendo las mismas líneas una y otra vez? Tuvimos que repetir las instrucciones para dibujar una línea y dar la vuelta cuatro veces. ¿No sería genial que en vez de dar todas las instrucciones le dijeramos al programa que repita cuatro veces lo qu ele dijimos? ¡Intentémoslo!\nPara hacer esto tenemos que usar CICLOS. Un ciclo ejecuta un grupo de instrucciones varias veces. Miremos este ejemplo donde se hace un triángulo:\nfor i in range(3): turtle.forward(50) turtle.left(120)  Intentemos entender lo que hace este código. for i in range(3): esta sentencia le dice al programa que las intrucciones que están debajo deben correrse dentro de un ciclo. range(3) dice cuántas veces va a repetirse el código (3 veces en este caso). La letra i es una variable y la usamos para llevar la cuenta de cuántas veces hemos corrido el ciclo.\nLa sintaxis \u0026ldquo;tricky\u0026rdquo; de Python - Parte 1 La Sintaxis es la forma en que escribimos los programas para hacerlos entendibles. Cuando hablamos español tenemos reglas (ortografía, gramática, etc) para podernos entender. El lenguaje Python tiene algo parecido para que la computadora pueda entender el código que escribimos.\nPrimero, notemos que al final de la línea que empieza con for agregamos dos punts (:); esto significa que la siguiente línea será parte del ciclo for. Si no ponemos los dos puntos, la computadora no sabrá qué hacer.\nFíjate que la siguiente línea tiene unos espacios en blanco, un \u0026ldquo;tab\u0026rdquo; le llamamos. Este tab le dice a la computadora que las sentencias deben de considerarse dentro del ciclo.\nAs well, we added a tab in front of some lines of code in the example above. The tab tells the computer these statements are considered a part of the for loop.\nPara dar en ejemplo de lo improtante que es poner el tab, veamos el siguiente código. Podemos ver que le quitamos el tab a la línea turtle.left(120) así que el código no funcionará como esperamos. El código repetirá la línea turtle.forward(50) tres veces y obteneremos una larga línea recta.\nfor i in range(3): turtle.forward(50) turtle.left(120)   Bueno, ahora tomemos el código que teníamos y modifiquemoslo un poco para dibujar un cuadrado en vez de un triángulo. Como pista, puedes volver a revisar lo que hicimos en la Avtividad 2.\n Actividad 3 - Dibujar un hexágono ¡Buen trabajo! Acabas de dibujar tu primera figura con Python y Turtle. Hagamos otros pequeños cambios al código que escribimos para hacer el cuadrado e intentemos hacer un hexágono. Alex es una abeja así que después de todo, él necesita dibujar hexágonos para crear su colmena.\nPiensa en cuántos lados tiene un hexágono. Si divides los 360° que tiene un círculo entre el número de lados del hexágono, tendrás los grados del ángulo para hacer tu nueva figura.\n Actividad 4 - Simplificando el código con funciones Ya dibujamos un hexágono. Pero es sólo uno de los muchos que necesita para construir su colmena. Una vez más parece we tendríamos que repetir el código varias veces para dibujar muchos hexágonos. Afortunadamente no tenemos qué hacerlo. ¡Las funciones vienen a nuestro rescate!\nFunciones Una función es una manera de agrupar líneas de código para hacer algo. Por ejemplo, turtle.forward(50) mueve la tortuga hacia delante 50 paso y turtle.left(120) gira la tortuga 120 grados hacia la izquierda. ¿Y qué pasaría si siempre quisieramos hacer esas dos cosas juntas? Podríamos ponerlas en una función que se llame draw_line() para que cada que mandemos llamar a esa función esas dos acciones juntas sucedan.\n Este es un ejemplo de la definición de funcion y cómo se usa\ndef draw_line(): turtle.forward(50) turtle.left(120)  La primera línea se llama cabecera o header. La palabra def le dice a la computadora que estamos definiendo una función. Después le pone a la función un nombre, en este caso draw_line. Finalmente, no olvidemos esto que va al final: ():, que le dice a la computadora que estamos empezando el cuerpo de la función.\nMaterial extra : Parámetros Dentro de los paréntesis () solemos poner los parámetros de la función. Un parámetro es un dato de entrada que le damos a la función para que esta la use para generar una salida. Por ejemplo, para hacer una suma necesitamos dos dígitos. Cada uno de estos dígitos sería un parámetro. En nuestro ejemplo no vamos a usar parámetros así que vamos a dejar los paréntesis en blanco.\n Similar a un ciclo for, lo que sea que queramos que la función ejecute debe tener un tab el inicio.\nPero no basta sólo con crearla sino que hay que mandarla llamar. Esto se hace escribiendo el nombre de la función seguido de paréntesis:\ndef draw_line(): turtle.forward(50) turtle.left(120) draw_line() # Aquí llamamos a la función  A esto se le llama una llamada de la función draw_line(). Una llamada corre el código que tiene dentro la función que estamos invocando.\nSi nos imaginamos la función como una recete, una llamada a una función es como hacer la receta.\nTips  Siempre asegúrate de que los nombres de tus funciones sean descriptivos. Es decir que digan qué hace la función. Las llamadas a tu función siempre deben estar escritas más abajo que la definición de tu función. \n La sintaxis \u0026ldquo;tricky\u0026rdquo; de Python - Parte 2 Notemos que las funciones usan una sintaxis similar a la que usan los ciclos for: tienes que poner el símbolo : al final de la línea donde se declara la función y todas las líneas que estén dentro de la función deben empezar con dos espacios.\n¿Pero qué pasaría si necesitaramos un ciclo for dentro de nuestra función? Entonces hay que combinar las reglas. A continuación hay un ejemplo de cómo poner un ciclo for dentro de una función:\ndef draw_line(): for i in range(3): turtle.forward(50)  ¿Te fijas cómo la línea turtle.forward(50) tiene dos tabs al inicio? Esto es porque ocupa un tab por estar dentro del ciclo for y otro tab por estar dentro de la función.\n Intentemos ahora crear nuestra propia función y llamémosla draw_hexagon(). Recuerda incluir la cabecera o header dela función, el número de lados que tiene un hexágono y el ángulo que debes usar: 60 grados.\n Actividad 5 - Dibujar la colmena ¡Llegamos a la prueba final! Vamos a crear la colmena para que Alex viva en ella. Afortunadamente una colmena es cimplemente 6 hexágonos así que podemos usar lo que ya aprendimos sobre funciones y ciclos para crear la colmena.\nEn esta actividad primero crearemos una función llamada draw_honeycomb(). Dentro del cuerpo de esta función pondremos un ciclo que se repita seis veces. Dentro del ciclo dibujaremos el primer hexágono con la función draw_hexagon() que ya tenemos construida. Ahora, movamos la tortuga un poco para que pueda pintar el siguiente hexágono. Para hacer eso necesitamos decirle al programa que al terminar de dibujar el hexágono se mueva hacia adelante 50 pixeles y luego gire a la derecha 60 grados.\nDibujar la colmena puede tomar un rato. Para que la tortuga vaya más rápido puedes modificar la velocidad a la que se mueve. Las velocidades van del 1 al 10 donde 1 es la más lenta y 10 la más rápida. Pon el siguiente código justo debajo de donde está la línea que cambia el color de la tortuga.\n turtle.speed(8)   Parte 2: Construyendo una Flor de Mandala ¡Buen Trabajo! Terminaste de construir un panal para la colmena de Alex, pero ¡Alex también necesita conseguir polen de las flores! ¿No seria agradable también agregar una flor a la imagen? En la parte 2, ¡crearemos una flor de mandala! (Permanece atento - te mostraremos como luce una flor de mandala.)\nActividad 6 - Moviendo la tortuga Nuestro primer paso es mover la tortuga a una nueva posición para dibujar la flor (¡no queremos dibujar la flor encima de la colmena!). Para hacer esto, primero necesitamos usar los siguientes métodos:\nturtle.penup() turtle.goto(x,y) turtle.pendown()  turtle.penup() le dice a la tortuga que levante su pluma para que no dibuje mientras se mueve. Entonces, con turtle.goto(x,y), le estamos diciendo a la tortuga la posición donde debe moverse. Después de eso le decimos a la tortuga que vuelva a bajar su pluma usando turtle.pendown() para que pueda comenzar a dibujar nuevamente.\nPista La x y la y en el método turtle.goto() son las coordenadas x y y de la tortuga. Queremos cambiar las coordenadas x, y de la tortuga desde (0, 0) que es el centro de la imagen, a algún lugar un poco mas lejos para que la flor de mandala no cubra parte de la colmena.\n Para completar esta actividad, mueve a la tortuga a la posición (300, 300) sobre el lienzo. Esto la moverá a la esquina superior derecha.\n Actividad 7 - Dibujando una figura 8 ¡Excelente! Ahora hagamos la figura de un 8 como primer paso para hacer una flor de mandala! Una figura de un 8 son solo dos círculos opuestos entre sí. Para hacer esto podemos hacer uso del método turtle.circle(x), el cual toma un entero x como el radio del círculo. (Puede recordar que radio * 2 es que tan ancho es el circulo.) Tener el radio como un argumento significa que podemos decidir qué tan grande o pequeño debe ser el círculo.\n import turtle turtle.circle(50)  En el ejemplo anterior, el círculo es de 100 píxeles de ancho y es dibujado en sentido contrario a las manecillas del reloj. Si el argumento para turtle.circle() es negativo, entonces el círculo se dibuja en dirección de las manecillas del reloj y es opuesto a la versión original.\nUsando esta información, crea una nueva función llamada figure_8() que dibuje una figura de un 8.\n Actividad 8 - Creando una flor de mandala Hemos terminado de crear nuestra primera figura de un 8! Ahora podemos usar la función figure_8() para crear una flor de mandala! Una flor de mandala es muchas figuras 8 puestas encima de otras en ángulos diferentes. Entonces, para hacer esto necesitamos usar un\u0026hellip; lo has adivinado, un ciclo!\nCrea una nueva función llamada mandala_flower(). En el ciclo llamaremos la función figure_8() que escribimos anteriormente para crear una figura de un 8. Luego, hay que girar la tortuga a la izquierda o derecha un cierto número de grados (por ejemplo, 10 grados). Repita estos pasos muchas veces para hacer una flor de mandala; es una buena idea crear un ciclo que se repita al menos 35 veces.\n Actividad 9 - Coloreando tu flor de mandala Ahora que ya tenemos la forma de una flor de mandala, ¡es momento de colorearla! Aun vamos a utilizar el método turtle.color(); sin embargo esta vez vamos a utilizar un valor RGB en lugar un valor de color en cadena de texto, así que podemos producir una gran variedad de colores.\nColores RGB (Red-Green-Blue) En la escuela primaria, puede que recuerdes que al mezclar colores, puedes producir nuevos colores. Por ejemplo, la combinación de rojo y azul hace el purpura. También podemos cambiar la cantidad de rojo y azul mezclados para crear diferentes tonos de purpura. La computadora hace algo similar para producir colores. Al combinar varias intensidades de rojo, verde y azul, podemos crear colores más variados, tal como como azul polvo, amarillo dorado y rosa salmón. Click aqui para ver los colres y su forma correspondiente en hexadecimal.\nEl el método turtle.color(), podemos especificar argumentos enteros correspondientes a la cantidad de rojo, verde y azul a mezclar. Cada número entero debe estar entre 0 y 255 inclusivos. Un ejemplo puede ser turtle.color(30, 100, 238), que produce un tono azul oscuro.\n Actualiza tu flor de mandala para usar un color de tu preferencia. ¡Siéntete libre de experimentar con colores diferentes!\n Actividad 10 - Randomizar el color de los pétalos de tu flor de mandala Hemos establecido con éxito el color de la flor de mandala en un valor RGB. Ahora, exploremos cambiar el color de los pétalos individuales de la flor de mandala\nHaremos uso de la biblioteca random de python. El método random.randint() nos permite elegir un valor aleatorio para cada uno de los valores rojo, verde o azul. Para elegir un valor que esté entre 0 inclusivo y 256 exclusivo (en otras palabras, entre 0 y 255 inclusivo), necesitamos usar random.randint(0, 256).\nUsa random.randint(0, 256) tres veces para generar tres valores aleatorios y utilizalos en el método turtle.color(). ¡Ahora deberías poder ver una flor de mandala multicolor! ¡Esta es definitivamente una flor de la que Alex estaría interesado en recolectar néctar!\n ¡Felicidades! ¡Ayudaste a Alex a hacer un panal y una flor! ¡Ahora puede vivir feliz en su colmena y hacer mucha miel! Su imagen final debería verse así:\nActividad 11 - Ahora es tu turno! Si queda algo de tiempo, ¡Intenta dibujar tus propias formas y diseños!

JavaScript is one of many programming languages and it is known as the programming language for the web. It used to control website behavior, such as button clicks, pop-up windows, data flows, and many other functions.\nVariables Variables are containers in your code that can hold a single number, word, or other information. This information can be used and changed by calling the variable later on throughout your program. This means that you are asking your program to access the information that you\u0026rsquo;ve stored.\nWith a few exceptions, variables can be named anything containing letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. BUT No matter what, they cannot have spaces and they should always start with a letter.\nVariables can hold different types of data, let\u0026rsquo;s go over the basic ones.\nThe Data Types Integers Integer is basically just a fancy name for any real number that is not a decimal. For example, integers are whole numbers like 3, 100, 6,000, -3, and so on!\n// this is a comment, these are used to describe what your code does // Below are different examples of variables  //Integer (non decimal number) variables examples:  var a = 5; var b = 10; var c = 15;  Doubles Doubles are your other \u0026ldquo;messy\u0026rdquo; numbers, the ones with that funky decimal. Examples are numbers like 0.5, 1.5, and so on.\n//Double (decimal number) variable examples:  var x = 0.5; var y = 1.5; var z = 2.0;  Strings Strings are just what programmers decided to call words. If it helps remind you that strings are words, think of them as a \u0026ldquo;string\u0026rdquo; of characters. Strings can be anything like your name or the name of favorite pet.\nStrings are surrounded by \u0026ldquo;quotation marks\u0026rdquo;\n//String (one or more words aka a \u0026#34;string\u0026#34; of characters) variable examples: //string variable values are surrounded by \u0026#34;quotation marks\u0026#34;  var company = \u0026#34;MICROSOFT\u0026#34;; var course = \u0026#34;Coding with Micro:Bits!\u0026#34;; var message = \u0026#34;Coding is so fun!\u0026#34;;  Characters Characters are single letters. They are surrounded by \u0026lsquo;single quotes\u0026rsquo;\n//Character (a single letter) variable example: //character variable values are surrounded by \u0026#39;single quotes\u0026#39;  var letter = \u0026#34;A\u0026#34;;  Booleans Sometimes programmers want to check if certain conditions are true or false. This information is stored in a Boolean data type.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re curious about why these are called Booleans, a guy named George Boole is the one that created them.\n//Boolean (true or false) variable example  var canPigsFly = false; var codingIsCool = true;  Math Operations Ah yes our favorite, computers are essentially calculators so it should be a given that we can do math on them. Here are examples of the math you can have in your JavaScript programs.\nAddition var a = a + b; //a = 15 var a += b; //a = 25  Subtraction var a = a - b; //a = 15 var a -= b; //a = 5  Multiplication var a = a * b; //a = 50 var a *= b; //a = 500  Division var a = a / b; //a = 50 var a /= b; //a = 5  Modulo Ah yes, the one that sounds scary but actually isn\u0026rsquo;t. Modulus operations just gives you the remainder after division. For example, 10 % 2 = 0 because when you divide 10 by 2, you have no remainder left.\nvar d = 10 % 2; //d= 0 var e = 5 % 2; //e= 1  Print Statements Sometimes you want your computer to actually display some text or the data your variables hold. To do this we use print statements.\nconsole.log(\u0026#34;This will show up in the console, but not the webpage\u0026#34;); alert(\u0026#34;This will display as a pop up window\u0026#34;); var userResponse = prompt(\u0026#34;Do you want to play a game?\u0026#34;);  Conditionals and Logical Operators Conditionals, most commonly called if-statements, are used to choose what code you want to run depending on the value of your variables or other conditions.\n//conditionals if (true) { //this section of code will run } if (false) { //this section of code will not run } var age = 10; if (age \u0026lt; 18) { // if age is less than 10  print(\u0026#34;You\u0026#39;re not an adult yet! :( \u0026#34;); }  Loops And last but not least, we have things called loops. These allow you to repeat parts of your code until a certain condition is met.\nThe alert() function you see in the code snippet below simply displays a pop-up displaying the parameter you pass to it, the parameter is what is inside the parantheses, in this case it is displaying the updated count value.\n//while loop - counts down from 10 var count = 10; while (count \u0026gt; 0) { alert(count); count--; } //for loop - counts down from 10 for (var i = 10; i \u0026gt; 0; i--) { alert(i); } //endless while loop while (true) { //this will happen over and over again forever since the condition will never be false. true is always true. } //break;\t//stops a loop immediately and moves to line below the loop  Getting started with Micro:Bits Now that you know the basics of JavaScript, you can use your knew skills to start programming your Micro:Bits!\nWhat is a Micro:Bit?

If the content is loading, and the CSS is not, it\u0026rsquo;s likely an issue with the baseURL setting.\nYou can change the baseURL when building content instead of changing the config.toml file. The example below will minify the CSS and JS, set the baseURL to the production .org URL and copy the results to the public directory.\nhugo --minify --baseURL \u0026quot;https://workshops.nuevofoundation.org/\u0026quot;\nTips and Tricks  Ignore Public: By default, running hugo with no parameters will build the site to the public directory. Make sure you do not add the public directory to source control (it\u0026rsquo;s in gitignore now). Left Nav: You can hide content from the left nav by settting metadata on the file hidden: true (like this page\u0026rsquo;s markdown!) Partials: For resuable components to a page, create a new partial under /themes/docdock/layouts/partials/flex/.
