We will use Python&amp;rsquo;s turtle library to draw a honeycomb for Alex.
Using Repl.it Today you will be using Repl.it to learn how to code in Python. Here is an example interactive window that you will use today:
Before we start, let&amp;rsquo;s first understand how the window works. The main.py file contains code, or instructions for the computer to run.</description></item><item><title>Starting Up</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/csharp-guess-the-word/starting-up/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2019 11:45:38 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/csharp-guess-the-word/starting-up/</guid><description>Starting Up The goal of today&amp;rsquo;s activity is to learn C# skills and incorporate your new-found knowledge to create a Guess The Word game! Let&amp;rsquo;s get the game set up.
Open your favorite internet browser (such as Edge, Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer), and go to https://aka.ms/nuevoguesstheword. Your screen should look like this:
We will ignore some of the details on this screen, but we will go over some of the basics that show up.</description></item><item><title>Starting Up</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/image-manipulation/starting-up/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/image-manipulation/starting-up/</guid><description>Welcome!
Click here to open repl.it in a new tab in your favorite browser (such as Edge, Firefox, Chrome, etc). Scroll to the bottom of the page, look for languages, search for Python and click it.
You should see the following screen:
In here you&amp;rsquo;ll see a main.py file. This file contains code, or instructions for the computer to run. Anything that results from running the code will be displayed on the right side.</description></item><item><title>The Basics - Drawing a colored line</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-turtle/the-basics/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2019 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-turtle/the-basics/</guid><description>Before Alex can learn how to create a beehive, he must first learn how to draw a colored line. We will add code to the below repl.it window, and we will do this in two parts.
First, we need tell the turtle what color we want the line to be. To do this, let&amp;rsquo;s type in:
turtle.color(&amp;quot;orange&amp;quot;) Let&amp;rsquo;s try to understand this line of code in more detail.
Strings Anything you see in quotation marks is called a string.</description></item><item><title>Writing to Console</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/csharp-guess-the-word/writing-to-console/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2019 11:45:38 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/csharp-guess-the-word/writing-to-console/</guid><description>Writing to Console Console.WriteLine means to tell the computer to print the sentence enclosed within the parentheses () out onto the console.
Working Together In the repl.it window below, press run. You see that Hello World is printed out to the screen on the right. Without removing the quotation marks, try changing &amp;quot;Hello World&amp;quot; to another sentence. Press run to see if anything changes. Add another Console.WriteLine below the current line to print a second sentence below the first sentence.</description></item><item><title>Writing to Console (Printing)</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/image-manipulation/writing-to-console/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/image-manipulation/writing-to-console/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start by doing a print statement. A print statement allows you to take control of the computer and make it print something out!
To start, copy and paste this text into your Repl.it main.py:
print(&amp;quot;Hello, World!&amp;quot;) Then, click run.
Watch your console say &amp;ldquo;Hello, World!&amp;rdquo; on the screen to the right! print tells the computer to print the sentence within the parentheses () into the console window, or the screen on the right.</description></item><item><title>Activity 1 - Drawing a square</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-turtle/activity-1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2019 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-turtle/activity-1/</guid><description>Kudos! You helped Alex draw a line! Now let’s step it up and help Alex draw a square. To draw a square, we need to follow these steps:

Comments are an easy way for developers to write notes in the code and communicate with others. Comments are ignored by the computer; thus, they are also an easy way to tell the computer to not run certain lines of code. There are two ways to create comments:
To comment out one line, place // in front of a line of code.</description></item><item><title>Activity 1</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/image-manipulation/activity-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/image-manipulation/activity-1/</guid><description>Without removing the quotation marks, try changing
&amp;quot;Hello, World!&amp;quot; to another sentence. For example,

You drew a square. But notice that we are writing the same lines over and over again! We had to repeat the instructions to draw a line and turn left 4 times. Wouldn’t it be great if we can give instructions once and tell the program to repeat it 4 times? Fear not, we can!
To do this, we need to use loops. Loops run a set of instructions multiple times.</description></item><item><title>Activity 1</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/csharp-guess-the-word/activity-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2019 11:45:38 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/csharp-guess-the-word/activity-1/</guid><description>Activity 1 Go to the code containing the GuessTheWord game.

You just drew your first shape in Python with Turtle! Now let’s slightly change the code we already wrote to draw a square to instead draw a hexagon. Alex is a bee, after all, and he needs to draw hexagons to build his first honeycomb.
To help you draw a hexagon, think of how many sides a hexagon has. How many degrees are in each angle of a hexagon?</description></item><item><title>Strings</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/csharp-guess-the-word/strings/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2019 11:45:38 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/csharp-guess-the-word/strings/</guid><description>Strings Anything that is surrounded in quotation marks is called a string. This is how a computer represents words or sentences. For example, &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;2&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;banana!&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Hello World&amp;quot; are strings, but Hello World and 2 are not strings, because the quotation marks are missing.
You can combine many strings together using the + operator. For example:
&amp;quot;Apple&amp;quot; + &amp;quot;Pineapple&amp;quot; produces the string &amp;quot;ApplePineapple&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Nuevo&amp;quot; + &amp;quot; &amp;quot; + &amp;quot;Foundation&amp;quot; produces the string &amp;quot;Nuevo Foundation&amp;quot;.</description></item><item><title>Strings</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/image-manipulation/strings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/image-manipulation/strings/</guid><description>Anything that is surrounded by quotation marks is called a string.

But this is just one of many hexagons Alex needs to build his honeycomb. Once again, it seems that we would have to repeat the code many times to draw multiple hexagons. Fortunately, we don&amp;rsquo;t have to! Functions to the rescue!
Functions A function is a way to group together lines of code to do something. For instance, turtle.forward(50) moves the turtle forward 50 steps, and turtle.</description></item><item><title>Activity 2</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/csharp-guess-the-word/activity-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2019 11:45:38 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/csharp-guess-the-word/activity-2/</guid><description>Activity 2 Find // TODO (ACTIVITY 2) in the GuessTheWord code. For the Guess the Word game, we will give the computer a word bank, and the computer will choose one of the words randomly to use for the game. So far, we have added the words &amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;World&amp;quot; to the word bank. However, a Guess the Word game with only two possible words to guess is not fun at all!</description></item><item><title>Activity 2</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/image-manipulation/activity-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/image-manipulation/activity-2/</guid><description>Start your code with the line print(&amp;quot;Nuevo&amp;quot; + &amp;quot; &amp;quot; + &amp;quot;Foundation&amp;quot;). If you run it, you should get the following output:
Nuevo Foundation Let&amp;rsquo;s try and find two more ways to print the string &amp;quot;Nuevo Foundation&amp;quot; using two plus (+) symbols in each print statement.
Once you make this work, you should have &amp;quot;Nuevo Foundation&amp;quot; printed out 3 times. In other words, your console should look like this after you press run:</description></item><item><title>Activity 5 - Drawing a honeycomb</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-turtle/activity-5/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2019 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-turtle/activity-5/</guid><description>This is the finale! Let&amp;rsquo;s create the honeycomb that Alex will live in. Fortunately, a honeycomb is simply 6 hexagons, so let&amp;rsquo;s combine our knowledge of functions and loops to make our honeycomb!
In this activity, create a new function called draw_honeycomb(). Inside the function body, create a loop that repeats 6 times. Inside the loop we have to first draw a hexagon using our draw_hexagon() function we previously defined. Next, move the turtle so it can draw the next hexagon.</description></item><item><title>Numbers</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/csharp-guess-the-word/numbers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2019 11:45:38 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/csharp-guess-the-word/numbers/</guid><description>Numbers The computer can also do regular math that you see in school.

Unlike strings or numbers, booleans store statements of truth: is what I am saying true or false? For example, if I ask, &amp;ldquo;Are you a robot?&amp;quot;, this question produces a true or false result, which we call a Boolean. In this case, since you are not a robot (hopefully!), we would produce false.
We can also use math operators to create boolean expressions. Here are some examples; however, notice the unusual symbols for &amp;ldquo;equal to&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;not equal to&amp;rdquo;:</description></item><item><title>Activity 3</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/image-manipulation/activity-3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/image-manipulation/activity-3/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s try to figure out the answers to the following using Python. Try printing out the result of the below (make sure you don&amp;rsquo;t miss any parentheses):
2 - 19 (3 + 5) * 6 (13 + 5 * 8) / (6 - (3 + 7)) Challenge Can you print out this statement? &amp;quot;527 time 199 is: __&amp;quot;
You will fill in the blank with the answer of what (527 * 199) is.</description></item><item><title>Activity 6 - Moving the turtle</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-turtle/activity-6/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2019 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-turtle/activity-6/</guid><description>Our first step is to move the turtle to a new location to draw the flower (we don’t want to draw the flower on top of the beehive!). To do this, we first need to use the following methods:
turtle.penup() turtle.goto(x,y) turtle.pendown() turtle.penup() tells the turtle to pick up its pen so it doesn’t draw while it is moving. Then, with turtle.goto(x,y), we are telling the turtle the position where the turtle moves to.</description></item><item><title>Boolean Operators</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/csharp-guess-the-word/boolean-operators/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2019 11:45:38 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/csharp-guess-the-word/boolean-operators/</guid><description>Booleans Operators You can also connect boolean expressions together using the &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (AND) and the || (OR) operator. For example, suppose I ask: &amp;ldquo;Are you a human, and is Nuvi a robot?&amp;rdquo; The word &amp;ldquo;and&amp;rdquo; connects the two true-false questions together. In this case, since it is true that you are a human, and it is also true that Nuvi is a robot, then the overall result is true.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a chart that describes what happens when we connect booleans together:</description></item><item><title>Booleans</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/image-manipulation/booleans/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/image-manipulation/booleans/</guid><description>Booleans are True or False statements. Unlike strings or numbers, booleans store statements of truth: is what I&amp;rsquo;m saying true or false?
For example, if I say, &amp;ldquo;You are a robot&amp;rdquo;, a boolean can store whether this statement is true. In this case, since you are not a robot (hopefully!), False would be stored.
What are the boolean answers to these questions about you?
I am a human. _______ I have 25 fingers.</description></item><item><title>Activity 7 - Drawing a figure 8</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-turtle/activity-7/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2019 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-turtle/activity-7/</guid><description>Great! Now let’s make a figure 8 as the first step to making a mandala flower! A figure 8 is just two circles that are opposite to each other. To do this we can make use of the turtle.circle(x) method, which takes an integer x as the radius of the circle. (You may recall that 2 * radius is how wide the circle is.) Having the radius as an argument means we can decide how big or small the circle should be.</description></item><item><title>Variables</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/csharp-guess-the-word/variables/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2019 11:45:38 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/csharp-guess-the-word/variables/</guid><description>Variables Variables are simply names that we can give to values such as strings, numbers and booleans.

We will make use of python’s random library. The random.randint() method allows us to choose a random value for each of the red, green, or blue value. To choose a value that is between 0 inclusive and 256 exclusive (in other words, between 0 and 255 inclusive), we need to use random.</description></item><item><title>Activity 4</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/csharp-guess-the-word/activity-4/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2019 11:45:38 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/csharp-guess-the-word/activity-4/</guid><description>Activity 4 This activity has four parts.

Functions are blocks of code that do just that. A function is a set of instructions that we give to the computer to store, and it can take in parameters (input data) and output data. A function in Python looks like this:

var counter = 1; while (counter &amp;lt;= 5) { Console.WriteLine(&amp;#34;Hello World&amp;#34;); counter = counter + 1; } Like an if statement, inside the () beside while, you should specify a boolean expression.

Now, let&amp;rsquo;s finally address the bug that was introduced in Activity 4.2. The game should continue to ask the player to guess letters if they have some lives remaining, and they have not yet won the game. Look at the for loop. As you might have noticed, even though you might have lives remaining, the game abruptly stops after only 3 guesses. We will replace this for-loop with a while-loop, with the correct looping condition.</description></item><item><title>Project Overview</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/image-manipulation/project-overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/image-manipulation/project-overview/</guid><description>Applications like Instagram and Snapchat allow its users to modify their images. For example, you can rotate your image and make it black and white. Ever wondered how these apps do it? The answer is using code!
Today, we’re going to learn how to do some image manipulations using Python!
Setting up the project To get started let’s start with importing a module. What does that mean? To do fun stuff with images, we need to unlock some functions to use.</description></item><item><title>Open an image</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/image-manipulation/open-image/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/image-manipulation/open-image/</guid><description>To change an image, we must open an image. We can use the Pillow Image module we just imported in the setup. Let’s first find some images to open. Find an image of your choice and download it. Once you have downloaded it, navigate back to your repl.it window and upload your image by clicking on the three dots and selecting ‘upload file’.
For example, to upload the cat.jpg file:</description></item><item><title>Rotate the image</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/image-manipulation/rotate-image/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/image-manipulation/rotate-image/</guid><description>Now that we have the image in our code, let’s turn it in different directions. To do that, let’s look at the Pillow Image function rotate().
The rotate image works using angles. For example, rotate(45) will tilt your picture sideways by 45 degrees. Using rotate(90) will turn your picture sideways.
Let’s give that a try! Let’s rotate the image before we save it:
image = Image.open("cat.jpg") image.rotate(90) image.save("myCat.jpg") Hmm, the picture didn’t seem to rotate.</description></item><item><title>Image Filters</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/image-manipulation/image-filters/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/image-manipulation/image-filters/</guid><description>I want to turn my cat black and white! Let&amp;rsquo;s do this by using the Pillow ImageFilter function filter() &amp;amp; convert().
To use the filter() function, you can specify the ImageFilter type within the parentheses. For example, image.filter(ImageFilter.BLUR) will make the image blurry. Or, if you use ImageFilter.CONTOUR instead, it will add a ‘sketch’ type effect to your image.
Add something like this below your previously added code
blurredImage = image.</description></item><item><title>Making a meme!</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/image-manipulation/making-meme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/image-manipulation/making-meme/</guid><description>So now that my image looks how I want it to look, I want to add some text. We can do that by utilizing the Pillow ImageDraw module. Let’s import that at the top of our file along with our other import statements.
from PIL import Image from PIL import ImageFilter from PIL import ImageDraw To allow us to add text, we must redraw the same image we used earlier for image manipulation.</description></item><item><title>Python Turtle Spanish</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-turtle/old/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Sep 2019 23:26:18 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-turtle/old/</guid><description>Python con Turtle Introducción Bienvenidos al mundo de Nueva Colmena!
