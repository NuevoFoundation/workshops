Hugo is a static site generator with a number of benefits:
Content authors can focus on content using markdown and not on the technical implementation of the site or CSS/page styling. Workshops are automagically added to the left table-of-contents and the workshops home page. Hugo works great locally (ex: on an airplane), and Hugo is the fastest static site generator, building the entire workshop site in &amp;lt;2 seconds.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/guidelines/getting-started/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jul 2020 14:08:32 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/guidelines/getting-started/</guid><description>Prerequisites Visual Studio Code Hugo Git.
