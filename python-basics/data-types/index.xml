This is how a computer represents words or sentences. For example, &amp;ldquo;a&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;2&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;banana!&amp;quot;, and &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; are strings, but 2 and Hello World are not strings, because the quotation marks are missing. You can combine many strings together using the + sign!
The strings that you combine do not have to be real words! For example, &amp;quot;Ap&amp;quot; + &amp;quot;ple&amp;quot; will produce the string &amp;quot;Apple&amp;quot;.</description></item><item><title>Numbers</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-basics/data-types/numbers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-basics/data-types/numbers/</guid><description>The computer can also do math. Use print() to print out the result from the math expressions. No quotation marks are needed for numbers! Unlike strings, you can do math on numbers.
print(7-3) #prints 4 print(5 * -6 + 7) #prints -23 print(24 * (8-3) / 6) #prints 20.0 The computer does division of integers differently from your regular calculator. Division of integers will exclude remainders or decimals.

Unlike strings or numbers, booleans store statements of truth: is what I&amp;rsquo;m saying true or false?
For example, if I say, &amp;ldquo;You are a robot&amp;rdquo;, a boolean can store whether this statement is true. In this case, since you are not a robot (hopefully!), False would be stored.
What are the boolean answers to these questions about you?
I am a human. _______ I have 25 fingers.</description></item></channel></rss>
