Functions are blocks of code that do just that. A function is a set of instructions that we give to the computer to store, and it can take in parameters (input data) and output data. A function in Python looks like this:
def my_function(): print(&amp;#34;Hello World!&amp;#34;) print(&amp;#34;My name is Nuvi!&amp;#34;) Letâ€™s analyze this piece of code.</description></item><item><title>Built in Functions</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-basics/functions/built-in/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-basics/functions/built-in/</guid><description>There are many built-in functions in python that can be used to increase the ease of writing code. Let&amp;rsquo;s discuss a few of them here.
sort() This function is used to sort the values in data structures such as arrays and lists.
arr = [8,5,1,4,6] arr.sort() print(&amp;#39;The sorted arr is :&amp;#39;,arr) #prints The sorted arr is [1,4,5,6,8] find() Returns the first occurence of the input(pattern) to the find() provided in the given string.</description></item><item><title>Built-in Math Functions</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-basics/functions/built-in-math/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2019 11:45:38 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-basics/functions/built-in-math/</guid><description>Python provides a number of important built-in functions that we can use without needing to provide the function definition. In this section, we will learn about some of the built-in math functions using that you can perform mathematical tasks on numbers.
The max() and min() functions give us the largest and smallest values in a list, respectively:
x = min(20, 10, 50, 25) #x = 10 print(x) y = max(20, 10, 50, 25) #y = 50 print(y) The abs() function give us the absolute(positive) value of number:</description></item></channel></rss>
