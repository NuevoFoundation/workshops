      <description>How the site is built The workshops subdomain content is built using the DocDocktheme for Hugo. Hugois a static site generator with a number of benefits:
Content authors can focus on content using markdown and not on the technical implementation of the site or CSS/page styling. Workshops are automagically added to the left table-of-contents and the workshops home page. Hugo works great locally (ex: on an airplane), and Hugo is the fastest static site generator, building the entire workshop site in &amp;lt;2 seconds.</description>
