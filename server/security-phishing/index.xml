      <description>Our Secret Agent Alice explains to Bob about Phishing!!!
What is Phishing? Just like when fishing, one uses a bait to catch fish on a rod, malicious hackers use different types of bait to steal personal information from unsuspecting people.
Phishing is a type of social engineering attack which is used to steal sensitive data, including login credentials, banking and credit card details.
It occurs when a Hacker, posing as a trusted entity, lures an individual using email, text message, or phone.</description>

      <description>Bob received the following email the other night.
What do you think is suspicious here? Let&amp;rsquo;s analyze the email: The sender&#39;s email address is suspicious and you don&#39;t know this email sender personally.
Lucrative offer in the subject line suggests it&#39;s too good to be true.
You received an email during irregular business hours.
These words show a sense of urgency.
The sender is asking you to click on a link or open an attachment that you don&#39;t know about.</description>

      <description>Alice goes on to explain different kinds of phishing scams other than the email phishing.
Smishing (SMS Phishing) Phishing conducted via Short Message Service (SMS), a telephone-based text messaging service. A smishing text, for example, attempts to entice a victim into revealing personal information via a link that leads to a phishing website.
In the above image, an unknown sender texts you about free deals on iPads and lures you into clicking a malicious link.</description>
