In EarSketch, functions are mostly used to organize different sections of a song. The most common musical form is A-B-A where each section is
four measures in length, and the A sections sound different from the B section.

Now that we learned how to use functions, let's try to use them to organize our songs better.

1. Define your function with a `startMeasure` parameter and `endMeasure` parameter.
2. Place the sounds you would like to have the function represent underneath your function definition.
3. Try to make multiple sections of a song (verse, chorus, intro, etc.) and define them with your functions. If you don't do this, and only use multiple `fitMedia` calls, you will notice that your program will become long and hard to understand. To help avoid having a large project file, use functions!

Your code should now look something like this:

```python
    from earsketch import *

    init()
    setTempo(120)

    fitMedia(HOUSE_DEEP_CRYSTALCHORD_001, 3, 1, 5)
    fitMedia(HOUSE_DEEP_CRYSTALCHORD_002, 3, 5, 9)

    # Section A
    def sectionA(startMeasure, endMeasure):
        fitMedia(RD_UK_HOUSE__AIRYPAD_1, 1, startMeasure, endMeasure)
        fitMedia(HOUSE_MAIN_BEAT_002, 4, startMeasure, endMeasure)
        fitMedia(HOUSE_ROADS_BASS_001, 5, startMeasure, endMeasure)  

    # Section B
    def sectionB(startMeasure, endMeasure):
        fitMedia(Y37_ORGAN_1, 2, startMeasure, endMeasure)
        fitMedia(HOUSE_ROADS_BASS_001, 5, startMeasure, endMeasure)
        fitMedia(RD_UK_HOUSE__ARPLEAD_1, 6, startMeasure, endMeasure)

    sectionA(1, 9)
    sectionB(9, 17)
    sectionA(17, 25)

    finish()
```
