### Meet DJ Nuevo

### Nuevo has new headphones! Can you find yours?

You got contacted to make Nuvi's next hit mixtape, but when you get to the studio, Nuvi says their next project is going to be produced all in code. This is something that hasn't been done before, are you up to the challenge? Look around yourself to find your headphones and get ready to
