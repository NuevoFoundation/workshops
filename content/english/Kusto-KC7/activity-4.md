### Introducing the Hackers


Now that you’ve completed your initial round of training, you are ready to work your first case in the SOC!

A security researcher tweeted that the domain *“immune[.]tech”* was being used by hackers. Apparently the hackers are sending credential (logins, passwords, etc) phishing emails from inside this domain.

⚠️NOTE! It is a commonly used safety protocol to use the format immune[.]tech or domain[.]com when mentioning potentially malicious links online. Adding these brackets around the dot prevents the creation of a clickable link. When searching logs, be sure to remove the brackets from the domain name. {{< /alert >}}

According to OSINT research your colleagues conducted, this domain may be used as part of a phishing campaign with the following stages:

{{< notice note >}}🎯**Key Point – Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)**: Security researchers and analysts often use free, publicly available data, like Twitter! We call this public data OSINT, and it can be a great way to get investigative leads. Like all public data sources on the internet, you should follow up any OSINT tip with rigorous analysis, rather than blindly trusting the source.{{< /notice >}}
