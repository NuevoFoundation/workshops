{{< alert theme="success" >}} **Congrats on making it through your initial Cyber Defender training!** 

If you're hungry for more, we have a few bonus activities here for you to try out. Keep in mind that the Scoreboard for these bonus activities will give some hints and show you when an answer is correct, however we will NOT publish an answer key for these, it's up to you to reveil the correct answers yourselves in the Scoreboard. ðŸ˜Š {{< /alert >}}
