## Cyber Blog Analysis

For this scenario, we'd like you to take a look at the blog post below and see if you can find evidence in **SecurityLogs2** that supports or disproves the information posted.

**What is UnhelpfulDesk?** 
 
UnhelpfulDesk malware implants are dropped by files with names that resemble legitimate IT functions, such as software updates or password resets, or medical research topics, such as vaccine research. These files are delivered to victims via malicious emails containing links to download the files.

Note: *Samples of the UnhelpfulDesk implant files detected by VulnerableArray researchers are available on VirusTotal.*
 
Once successfully deployed, the UnhelpfulDesk implant executes reconnaissance via the following commands: 
 ```
  ping 8.8.8.8    
  whoami    
  net user Administratr 
 ```
Following this, the malware will encrypt files on the machine and demand a ransom to decrypt the files. The ransom note is pulled down from Pastebin as shown below: 
```
curl https://pastebin[.]com/HOW%20TO%20RECOVER%20YOUR%20FILES.txt 
```

## Now it’s up to you… 
 
Our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) has asked you to evaluate this report from VulnerableArray and determine whether it is accurate using the logs from the **SecurityLogs2** database.     

🤔  While making your assessment, consider the following questions: 

{{< alert theme="success" >}} 
*Question 1.	Do all the reported indicators belong to the same cluster of activity? How do you know?*
 {{< notice note >}}
  **Hint:** Use the Diamond Model (Adversary, Victim, Infrastructure, Capabilities) to help you think about clustering distinct groups of activity. It Look for similarities and differences in each of the four Diamond Model vertices.  {{< /notice >}}
 
*Question 2.	The report claims that the UnhelpfulDesk malware is to ultimately deploy ransomware and encrypt files on an infected system. Do you agree with this assessment? Or do you see evidence of alternative actions on objectives?*
 {{< notice note >}}
  **Hint:** Try looking for activity related to the malware-based indicators shared in the blog, then identify a few compromised systems. Do you see post-compromise activity on any of these systems that’s different from the ransomware described in the blog? {{< /notice >}}
 
*Question 3.	What analytical mistakes, if any, were made by the authors of the blog?* 
 {{< notice note >}}
  **Hint:** Some processes are executed automatically by the malware upon execution. Other processes are run manually (hand-on-keyboard) by the operator after the command and control channel is establish. {{< /notice >}}
 
 
*Question 4.	Is the UnhelpfulDesk malware unique to the ITINIUM actor? How do you know?* 
 {{< notice note >}}
  **Hint:** The updater.dll implants appear to be dropped from files with two separate themes (IT and research). Think about why that might be the case.  {{< /notice >}}
 
*Question 5.	Are there multiple actors targeting Envolve Labs? If so, can you describe the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) of each of them? How are they similar? How are they different?* 
{{< notice note >}}
  **Hint:** Compare and contrast the diamond model for each of the observed clusters of activity. {{< /notice >}}
 
*Question 6. How might gaps in visibility have contributed to the conclusions of the blog author(s)? How might they contribute to your own analytical assessments?*
