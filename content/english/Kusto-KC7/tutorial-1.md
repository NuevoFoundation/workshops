## What is Threat Intelligence?

**Threat Intelligence Analysts**:

{{<icon name="user" size="large">}} Learn about adversaries ... and share knowledge with public/private sector partners

{{<icon name="time" size="large">}} Track adversaries over time ... to understand the changing threat landscape

{{<icon name="lock" size="large">}} Implement defenses ... and work with product development teams to protect customers

Data alone does not equal intelligence. Security logs on their own don't tell you anything impactful until you process them. Once a threat intelligence analyst processes the data and information, with the context of the adversaries they track and the context of the changing of the threat landscape, they can begin coming up with a story and timeline of what my have happened. To understand what those threats mean, why they have occurred, and how it has affected your company ... that is true threat intelligence.

## What is the Cyber Kill Chain?

The Cyber Kill Chain, originally developed by Lockheed Martin, is a framework for identifying and preventing cyber attacks. This framework identifies 7 steps that adversaries must complete in order to achieve their objective.

## Understanding the Diamond Model

The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis provides a method for analyzing the characteristics of cyber attacks. This model emphasizes the relationships between 4 components: **the adversary, capabilities, infrastructure, and victims**. The theory this is based on is that for every cyber attack, there exists "an **adversary** taking a step toward an intended goal by using a **capability** over **infrastructure** against a **victim** to produce a result."

## What is KC7?

This leads us into why we chose to call this game KC7; it helps step people through the 7 stages of the cyber Kill Chain described above.

KC7 is a very unique game and immersive cybersecurity analysis simulation that was developed by security experts at Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence Center, a team that focuses on tracking the most sophisticated cyber actors in the world.  **KC7 is a game designed to teach people how to apply cybersecurity knowledge and develop analysis skills using realistic data.** This training gives participants the opportunity to learn and apply cyber threat analysis skills as they defend a simulated company from hackers.
