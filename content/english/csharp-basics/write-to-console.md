## Your first C# program

Our first excercise is to get comfortable with the structure of a simple C# application that writes to the console.

Letâ€™s try to run a C# program that prints `Hello World` to the console.  The line of code `Console.WriteLine ("Hello World");` does this for us.  It tells the computer to write whatever is inbetween the () to the screen.

Launch the repl and fork it. Give it a try by pressing the **run** button.  The output will appear on the right.

### Let's write some code!

Add a new line of code below the first line to print "Hello *your name*".  It should look something like this.

You should see your output on the right side of the screen. Cool huh?  

Let's try printing other things. Add some additional lines of code to:
1. Print numbers by putting numbers in the parenthesis (i.e. `Console.WriteLine(42);`). No double quotes needed.
2. Put some text together (i.e. `Console.WriteLine("Hi " + "Sally");`)

### Did you notice that all the statements you typed printed on different lines?

Sometimes we want to write on the same like. We use a slightly different code `Console.Write` instead of `Console.WriteLine`.

Add two lines of code:
```csharp
Console.Write("I like to eat ");
Console.Write("apples.");
```

And give it a try.

### !! Important !! Sometimes you can't just put characters in between " "

When putting characters in between `" "` in a print statement, sometimes it's easy to confuse the computer on what characters to print.

For example, how do we tell computer to print `"`?

If you type `Console.WriteLine(""");`, you will get an error because the computer can't identify where the text ends!

Instead, certain characters need to be <b>escaped</b> by adding a `\` in front of it.

```csharp
Console.Writeline("\"");`  // this prints out "
```
