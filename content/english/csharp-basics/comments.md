## Make a Comment

When creating a C# program, we can jot down some notes by adding one line comment using `//` or multi-line comment using `/*` and `*/` (Note: The instructions in the previous activities were written as comments).

Also, adding comments will not affect the program whatsoever. So, you can add any notes with comments throughout your code!

     // sample one line comment
     /* sample
      * multi-line
      * comment */

You can comment you code so the computer won't run it.

`Console.Write("I like to eat");`

`// Console.Write("apples.");`

Will write "I like to eat" to the console but won't write "apples".
