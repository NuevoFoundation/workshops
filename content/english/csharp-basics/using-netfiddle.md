### Using .NET Fiddle
Today you will be using .NET Fiddle to learn how to code in C#. 

Before we start, let's first understand how the window works. On the left side you have a list of options.  These have all been set for you, so you do not need to worry about those.  The center of the screen contains code, or instructions for the computer to run. By pressing the **run** button (the button with the triangle in the middle at the top of the frame), you tell the computer to perform the instructions in the code.  The results from running the code will be displayed on the bottom of the screen.

Spend some time and get to know the tool below.

### Some tips on C#

A few important tips:
1. Each line of code ends with a semicolon `;`
2. There will be code in the examples that you don't understand.  That is ok, ignore for now and focus on the task you are working on.

## Saving your work

If you want to save your work throughout these exercises, you will need to sign up for a .NET Fiddle account, if you do not yet have one. 

Click the button below to sign up for a .NET Fiddle account - you will need an email account in order to sign up. If you already have a .NET Fiddle account, you can login to your account using the below button as well.

Then, you can now *fork* the Fiddle, which simply means to make a copy of the program, so that we can make and save our own changes to it. Click on the "Fork" button on the top.

After forking the Fiddle, you will see a window similar to the one below:
