## Sign up and Launch .NET Fiddle

Today you will be using .NET Fiddle to learn how to code in C#. Before starting, you will need to sign up for a .NET Fiddle account, if you do not yet have one. 

Click the button below to sign up for a .NET Fiddle account - you will need an email account in order to sign up. If you already have a .NET Fiddle account, you can login to your account using the below button as well.

<a class="my-2 mx-4 btn btn-info" href="https://dotnetfiddle.net/SignUp" target="_blank">Sign up for .NET Fiddle</a>

Next, launch the .NET Fiddle console we will use today by clicking the below button. You should see the screen below.

We will now *fork* the Fiddle, which simply means to make a copy of the program, so that we can make our own changes to it. Click on the "Fork" button on the top.

After forking the Fiddle, you will see a window similar to the one below:

Every time you see the "Launch .NET Fiddle" button, you will need to follow the above steps to fork the project in order to complete an activity. Ask for help if you are having trouble with forking the projects!

### Using .NET Fiddle
Before we start, let's first understand how the window works. On the left side you have a list of options.  These have all been set for you, so you do not need to worry about those.  The center of the screen contains code, or instructions for the computer to run. By pressing the **run** button (the button with the triangle in the middle at the top of the frame), you tell the computer to perform the instructions in the code.  The results from running the code will be displayed on the bottom of the screen.

### Some tips on C#

A few important tips:
1. Files containing C# code have a **.cs** suffix, such as **main.cs**. 
2. Each line of code ends with a semicolon `;`
3. The other files shown in the file list are necessary for our program to run, but not important for this project.
4. There will be code in the examples that you don't understand.  That is ok, ignore for now and focus on the task you are working on.
