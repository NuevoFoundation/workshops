A high-level programming language is called high-level because it is quite a few steps away from the original code run on a computer's Central Processing Unit (CPU). High-level code is meant to be used by humans and is much easier to understand than low-level code. The high-level code is later translated into a low-level language, which can only be perceived and run by a specific CPU. For the code to work, every single line of code written in a high-level language must be translated into machine language before being implemented by the computer.
