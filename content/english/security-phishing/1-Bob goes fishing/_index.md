Meet our friend **Bob**. **Bob** is a nice and jolly gentleman. 
His hobbies are travelling and fishing.  One fine evening **Bob** 
received an email saying he won a free trip to "Bahamas". 
**Bob** got excited. He immediately clicked the link to enter
his personal details and waited for his itinerary to come. 


**Bob** decided to go shopping for his trip. He bought new clothes 
and a new fishing rod.

Although it has been 24 hours and he still didn't receive a confirmation 
for his trip. Another day passed and nothing. The next day he decided to go
meet his good friend **Alice**.

**Bob** told **Alice** all about the email,
the trip to Bahamas, his new clothes and how he cannot wait to go fishing. 
**Alice** being a secret agent was suspicious, and asked **Bob** to show her 
the email. 


On reading the email **Alice** sighed, "Bob you have been `phished`!"
