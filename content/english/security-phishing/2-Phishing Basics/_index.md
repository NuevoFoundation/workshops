Our Secret Agent Alice explains to Bob about Phishing!!!

## What is Phishing?

Just like while fishing, one uses a bait to catch fishes on a rod, malicious <b>hackers</b>
use different types of bait to steal personal information. 

Phishing is a type of social engineering attack which is used to steal sensitive data, 
including login credentials, banking and credit card details. <br>
It occurs when a <b>Hacker</b>,
posing as a trusted entity, lures an individual using email, text message, or phone.<br> The recipient
is then tricked into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the installation of a malicious
software, or revealing of sensitive data.


## What went wrong?

Bob was enticed by an email from a hacker offering him a free trip to Bahamas to steal his personal
information.
