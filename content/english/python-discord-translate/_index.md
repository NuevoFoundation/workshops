## Overview
Welcome to the course **Python: Building a Discord Translator Bot**!

![Nuvi](media/NF_mascot.jpg)
 Nuvi just created a new Discord server so all of his friends around the world can hang out, share ideas, and plan creative projects. There’s only one problem: not everyone speaks the same language. Some friends type in English, some in Spanish, some in Portuguese, and others in Korean or Chinese. Conversations get broken up, people feel left out, and Nuvi wants everyone to feel included.

So Nuvi has an idea: build a **translation bot** that lives right inside the Discord server. You’ll start with simple slash commands, then upgrade the bot so users can register their preferred language (English or Spanish) and automatically get private (DM) translations every time someone else chats in the other language. To make that happen, Nuvi (and you!) will learn how to:

- Connect Python code to Discord using a bot user
- Listen for messages safely (with the right intents)
- Run a local translation service (LibreTranslate)
- Detect whether a message is English or Spanish
- Translate messages automatically for registered users
- Send translations privately so the channel stays clean
- Still offer a manual `/translate` command as a fallback

By the end, you’ll have a working bot that helps people who speak different languages chat together. You’re not just writing code—you’re building a bridge between friends.
