In this section, you'll prepare your development environment for building a Discord bot with translation features. You'll install required tools, create or select a Python runtime, and organize a clean project folder to keep secrets secure and code modular.

We'll focus on:
- Prerequisites (Python version, pip, virtual environment)
- Installing core dependencies (discord libraries, dotenv, translation SDKs later)
- Environment variables and protecting secrets (bot token!)
- Project folder structure foundations

Let's get started!
