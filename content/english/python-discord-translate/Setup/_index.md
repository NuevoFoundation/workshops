Nuvi just launched a new global Discord hub where friends from different countries are joiningâ€” but early chats are already splitting into language bubbles. Before you can help Nuvi build the translator bot that will connect everyone, you need a reliable place to write and run code. In this section, you'll prepare your development environment for building a Discord bot with translation features. You'll install required tools, create or select a Python runtime, and organize a clean project folder to keep secrets secure and code modular. Think of this as building the robot workshop before assembling the translator parts.

We'll focus on:
- Prerequisites (Python version, pip, virtual environment)
- Installing core dependencies (libraries)
- Project folder structure foundations
