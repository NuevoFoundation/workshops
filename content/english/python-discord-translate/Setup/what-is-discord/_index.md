## Overview

[Discord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord) is an online platform where people build communities (called **servers**) to chat using text, voice, or video. You can think of a server like a group for a club, a game, a class, or friends. Inside each server are **channels**. Channels help organize conversations. For example, one channel might be for homework help and another for talking about videogames.

### Key Ideas
- **Servers:** Spaces people create for groups or topics.
- **Channels:** Rooms inside a server (text or voice) for different discussions.
- **Users:** People with accounts who can join servers (sometimes by invite).
- **Bots:** Computer programs (like the one you will build!) that can help with tasks such as moderating chat, translating messages, or playing music.

Discord was first popular with gamers, but now it’s used by study groups, hobby communities, and classrooms too.


### Safety Note
Never share your personal information (full name, address, phone, school) with strangers online. Keep your bot token (password) secret too (it lets someone control your bot if they get it).

## Create a Test Server for Your Bot
Before you invite your bot, it’s best to have a private server where you can experiment safely.

1. Open the Discord app (or go to https://discord.com/app in a browser and log in).
2. Look at the far left sidebar (the column with server icons). Click the green plus button (`Add a Server`).
3. Choose `Create My Own` (you don’t need a template).
4. If it asks “For me and my friends” vs “For a club or community,” either is fine — pick one.
5. Give it a name like `Bot Test Lab` or `Translator Bot Dev`.
6. (Optional) Upload an icon so it’s easy to spot.
7. Click `Create`.

You now have a blank server with some default channels (like `#general`). You’ll invite your bot here later so you can try your slash commands without bothering other people.

### Optional Clean-Up / Organization
- Create a new text channel named `#bot-testing` (right‑click the server name → `Create Channel`).
- Delete extra channels you don’t need yet to reduce clutter.

### Keep It Private
Only invite people you trust while you’re learning. You can always make a “real” server later once your bot is stable.

Next, you’ll learn how to set up your development environment and start coding the bot.
