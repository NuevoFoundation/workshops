## Overview

[Discord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord) is an online platform where people build communities (called **servers**) to chat using text, voice, or video. You can think of a server like a group for a club, a game, a class, or friends. Inside each server are **channels**. Channels help organize conversations. For example, one channel might be for homework help and another for talking about videogames.

### Key Ideas
- **Servers:** Spaces people create for groups or topics.
- **Channels:** Rooms inside a server (text or voice) for different discussions.
- **Users:** People with accounts who can join servers (sometimes by invite).
- **Bots:** Computer programs (like the one you will build!) that can help with tasks such as moderating chat, translating messages, or playing music.

Discord was first popular with gamers, but now itâ€™s used by study groups, hobby communities, and classrooms too.


### Safety Note
Never share your personal information (full name, address, phone, school) with strangers online. Keep your bot token (password) secret too (it lets someone control your bot if they get it).
