Nuvi’s server is live and people are joining—but the translation helper doesn’t exist yet. In this section, you'll create the very first building block: a minimal Discord bot using Python. You’ll register a Discord application, generate a bot token, invite the bot to a server you control, and implement a first command to make sure everything works. Think of this as powering on Nuvi’s assistant core before adding language features.

We'll focus on:
- Creating a Discord application & bot user
- Safely managing your bot token
- Writing a minimal Python bot
- Running the bot locally and validating connectivity

Let's get started!
