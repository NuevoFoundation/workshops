## Overview

In this section, you'll create a minimal Discord bot using Python. You'll register a Discord application, generate a bot token, invite the bot to a server you control, and implement a first command to make sure everything works!

We'll focus on:
- Creating a Discord application & bot user
- Safely managing your bot token
- Writing a minimal Python bot
- Running the bot locally and validating connectivity

Let's get started!
