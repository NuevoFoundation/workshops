Now that Nuvi is all set and ready to move, let's have him welcome aliens into the universe! Locate the alien png file called "alien_pink" and drag and drop it into the Drawings folder. Then, drag and drop the alien_pink from the Drawings folder into the hierarchy. Rescale the enemy to match Nuvi's size as it is too large.

Now, if we were to run the game, Nuvi runs on top of the pink alien. We want Nuvi to collide with it. To do this, add a BoxCollider2D on the alien like we did with Nuvi and resize it if necessary. Now, if we were to run the game again, Nuvi runs into the alien instead of over it!
