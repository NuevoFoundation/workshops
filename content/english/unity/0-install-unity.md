We need to help Nuvi shoot the aliens, but programming everything from scratch might be a bit too hard for us. Unity is a tool that has some basic parts of game-building simplified for us, so all we need to do is drag and drop some things, and write a bit of simple C# code.

So, before we can do anything, you need to download and install Unity!
Even if you already have Unity installed, look through this activity to make sure you have the right version of Unity.

## Unity Hub

First, let's download the [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download?_ga=2.142217974.513534012.1631151100-1023620192.1630193772). This is an application that helps you manage your Unity projects.

Click on "Download Unity Hub".

## Unity Editor

Now let's download and install the [right version of Unity](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases?version=2019.4&page=2).

Click on "LTS Release 2019.4.19f1". You should see a huge list expand, but don't worry about looking at everything.
Under "Unity Editor Download Assistant", you should see a Unity Hub download and 2 Unity downloads. If your computer is Windows, click on "Download (Win)". If your computer is a Mac, click on "Download (Mac)".

Before you are able to create a new project in Unity, you need a Unity ID. If you don't have one already, you simply need to make a new project to prompt the login page to appear where you can create a new ID. Note that you need an email address to make a Unity ID.

NOTE: VISUAL STUDIO?

Now, to start working on a new project, open Unity Hub and click on the blue button that says "NEW". Name your project however you like, and choose a place to create your project folder. Make sure you have "2D" chosen as your project template, as shown in the screenshot.
