We need to help Nuvi shoot the aliens, but programming everything from scratch might be a bit too hard for us. Unity is a tool that has some basic parts of game-building simplified for us, so all we need to do is drag and drop some things, and write a bit of simple C# code.

So, before we can do anything, you need to download and install Unity!
Even if you already have Unity installed, look through this activity to make sure you have the right version of Unity.

## Downloading Unity

First, let's [choose and download Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download?_ga=2.142217974.513534012.1631151100-1023620192.1630193772).

Click on "Choose your Unity + download".

Then, click on **"Individual"** and under **"Personal"**, select "Get Started". After that, we would want to select "Start here" Under "First-Time Users". This will begin to download Unity.

After Unity finishes downloading, open up Unity, which will then begin the Unity Hub setup, an application that will help you manage your Unity projects.

A pop up window will appear. Agree to the user agreements, select the destination folder to where you want to download in your computer, install, and then run Unity Hub by selecting "Finish"!

## Unity Hub

The Unity Hub installer will then appear. Make sure your Unity version is **"2019.4"**. If not, we can worry about that later.
Once you hit install, you will then be taken to a page where you have to create a Unity ID. If you don't have one yet, create a new ID. If you already have one, select, "I already have a Unity ID" and input your information. After inputting your information, the page will then ask you to choose a template for a microgame. This only occurs because we chose "First-Time Users", so Unity wants new users to play around with the given projects to help them understand Unity better. We will be using our own projects to teach, so for now, you can choose a random template you might want to explore later and hit "continue" and "Launch Unity". Unity will then launch the microgame, but since we are not using it, simply close Unity.

If your version of Unity is not 2019.4, then open up the Unity hub and to the left of the window, select "Installs". Click the "ADD" button and select the version you want. You can select the latest version or the version we are using for this project, **"2019.4.19f1 (LTS)"**. Then, the Unity Hub will take you to a page where you can choose the libraries you can include. Make sure that the Mac and Windows Build Support are selected! Then click done.

Now, to start working on a new project, open Unity Hub and click on the blue button that says "NEW". Name your project however you like, and choose a place to create your project folder. Make sure you have "2D" chosen as your project template, as shown in the screenshot.
