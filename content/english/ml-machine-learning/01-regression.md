# What is regression?
Regression is a technique to model the relationship between a feature (independent variables) and a prediction (dependent variables). It helps us understand how the value of a dependent variable is changing based on the value of the independent variable. When applied properly it helps us predict values ðŸ˜¯!

|Regression|

Regression is a powerful technique that lets us find a line or a curve that fits the data we have. By doing regression, we can create or reuse `mathematical models` that show how the dependent and independent variables are related. [Mathematical models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHtsuOB-TPw) are useful because they help us understand a system and make predictions based on the system's variables. Sometimes, the mathematical model we choose may not match the data well, so we have to look for a better model that can capture the patterns we see.

## Example 1: How do we know if it is going to rain?
Whenever you use your phone, watch a news cast, or just ask in the internet "What is the chance of rain today?", mathematical models are used by meteorologists to predict if there will be the possibility of rain. You may wonder,  What `variables` are taken into consideration when running those mathematical models? Is the smell of rain enough?

{{% expand "**What variables should you consider in order to know if it is going to rain?**"%}}

- Temperature &rarr; Is it hot, is it cold or is it on the sweet spot?
- Altitude &rarr; Depending on how high you are relative to the ground places can become cooler or warmer.
- Location &rarr; Where you are matters. (e.g: Forest, Beach, Mountain Range, Desert, etc) 
- Humidity &rarr; Do you feel that the air is heavy? Is there enough water in the air for it to rain?
- Time of the Year &rarr; What month is it? What season are we currently on?
- And many many more!

There are many more variables to consider whenever we think there is a chance of rain. At the end of the day the "**chance of rain**" is the dependent variable while the other properties we have mentioned above are the independent variables. The chance of rain is dependent on the values of the other variables mentioned.

### Exercise 1
Suppose that someone wants to know the type of shapes they have based on the area of the shape. 

1. Is that even possible? Can someone know what shape they have based on the area?
{{% expand "**Click to show answer**" %}}  
***No***, as you can quickly guess there is no relation between the **area** and the type of shape a figure may have.

For example, a square of side length 3 has an area of 9.

<h3>
\[
    3 \cdot 3 = 9
\]
</h3>

But so does a triangle with width of 6 and height of 3.
<h3>
\[
    (6 \cdot 3)/2 = 9
\]
</h3>

{{% /expand %}}

2. If the area is not a good variable or property to understand the type of shape we can have. We need to come up What relationship can we use in order to know what is the type of shape?
{{% expand "**Click to show answer**" %}}  

***The number of **sides** it has! As the number of sides increases, you can know the type of shape.***

If you noticed in our table, we have built a linear relationship that can be represented as X=Y. 

X &rarr; **the number of sides**
Y &rarr; **type of shape**

There you go, you created your first machine learning model!
{{% /expand %}}
<br>

A model, in the case of our previous example, is just a function that is built to establish a relationship between our dependent variable and independent variables. For example, functions such as lines (y = ax + b), parabolas (y = a(x -h)^2), cubic curves, (y=ax^3+bx^2+cx+d), and many more can be used as models.

### How to make sure your model fits the data?

When we perform analysis using a machine learning model that already exists we need to ensure that we select the appropriate model and that somewhat represents our data. On the image below you can see that the data points represent a parabola. It is very likely that the model we need to use is a parabolic model something like this...

<h2>
\[
    y = a(x -h)^2
\]
</h2>

When you use a parabolic model you need to know where the vertices of the parabola will land in order to predict where a new point will be. You could go ahead and run a model, setting no vertices and end up like the "Under-fitting" image, or setup way to many vertices and end up like the "Over-fitting" image. We want to set it just right enough so that our model "fits" the data and new data points can be represented using the model.

|Image 1: Under-Fitting and Over-Fitting|

You always need to make sure that the model you choose to represent your data fits what you are working on. Otherwise, you might have one of two issues:
- **Under-Fitting**
    
    This happens when you are unable to find a relationship in the data you have been given. This often happens when there is not much data to use.

- **Over-Fitting**
    
    When you are trying to accommodate every possible value in your data, even the ones that don't represent anything. By doing this you might be choosing values that are **outliers** and do not represent the reality of things. For example, having a shape that has 1 or 2 lines doesn't make sense.
