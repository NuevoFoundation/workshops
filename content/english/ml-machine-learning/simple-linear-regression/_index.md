# What is regression?
Linear regression is a technique to model the relationship between independent variables and dependent variables. As the name suggests the relationship between dependent and independent variables is linear. This helps us know how the value of a dependent variable is changing based on the value of the independent variable. It helps us predict continuous values ðŸ˜¯!


# Simple Linear Regression
Linear regression is the process of predicting
Consider an example where there is only one independent variable and we need to predict a value, the dependent variable. If we wanted to represent this mathematically it would be done as a linear function. As you may have expected by the name, the function is just a straight line:

<h1>
\[
    y = f(x) = ax + b
\]
</h1>

- X is the independent variables
- A is the "weight" of the dependent variable
- B is the intercept. This is obtained when the value of the independent variable is 0.
