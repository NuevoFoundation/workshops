# What is regression?
Regression is a technique to model the relationship between a feature (independent variables) and a variable feature (dependent variables). This helps us know how the value of a dependent variable is changing based on the value of the independent variable. It helps us predict values ðŸ˜¯!

Regression gives a line or a curve by plotting dependent and independent variables. The line or curve fites the data points based on the prediction we made.

When we apply regression, we need to come up with a matematical model that is able to fit the regression.

## Example 1: Predicting the Weather Temperature
For example, say you need to predict the temperature of a place. What do you need?

- Altitude
- Location
- Month
- Year
- Humidity
- Atmospheric Pressure

The **temperature** is the dependent variable while the other properties we have mentioned above are the independent variables.

## Fitting Your Model
Suppose you have a bunch of shapes that you want to classify based on the number of sides it has. How would you come up with a solution for that?

{{% expand "**Click to show answer**" %}}  
As the number of sides increases, you can determine the type of shape.

// TODO: Add image to show the relation of # of sides and shapes.

{{% /expand %}}

Now suppose that you want to know the type of shapes based on the area of the shape. Is that possible?

{{% expand "**Click to show answer**" %}}  
No, as you can quickly guess no relation will let us know the type of shape based on the area.
{{% /expand %}}

You always need to make sure that your models fits what you are working on, otherwise you might have one of two issues:

**Underfitting** &rarr; when you are unable to find a relationship in the data you have been given. This often happens when there is not much data to use.

**Overfitting** &rarr; when you are trying to accomodate every value in your data. By doing this you might be choosing values that are **outliers** and do not represent the reality of things.

# Simple Linear Regression
Consider an example where there is only one independent variable and we need to predict a value, the dependent variable. If we wanted to represent this mathematically it would be done as a linear function. As you may have expected by the name, the function is just a straight line:

<h1>
\[
    y = f(x) = ax + b
\]
</h1>

- X is the independent variable.
- A is the "weight" of the dependent variable.
- B is the intercept. This is obtained when the value of the independent variable is 0.
