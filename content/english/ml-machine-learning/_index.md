Oh wow! Look at you wanting to get into the difficult stuff. Don't worry, I will guide you through the journey so that you can understand how it all works ðŸ˜‰. In this section, you can find workshops that explain the basics of machine learning. We will start with the concept of **linear regression** which is the simplest form of machine learning. If you want to jump into another topic of machine learning. 

**Machine Learning** is the branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on using data and algorithms to mimic the way humans learn and little by little improve its accuracy.
