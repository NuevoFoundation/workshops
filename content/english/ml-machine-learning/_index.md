Oh wow! Look at you wanting to get into the difficult stuff. Don't worry, we will guide you through the journey so that you can understand how it all works ðŸ˜‰. In this section, you'll find an introductory workshop that gives you an introduction on machine learning. 

For context, **[Machine Learning](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/machine-learning-explained)** is the branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on using thousands, millions or even billion data points alongside special algorithms that, once combined, let us predict outcomes. These special algorithms are designed to learn similarly to how humans learn. Little by little, they improve their accuracy and ultimately predict outcomes with lots of precision. (e.g: )

One of the simplest ways to understand machine learning and get your hands dirty in the subject is the topic of **simple linear regression**. But before we jump in let us think about it something for a second.

- What do you have to do to improve your memory? ðŸ¤”

Repetition.

Always remember, "practice makes perfect". Similar to humans, machines can do the same.

- Why are you able to know that something will happen again? Or that something similar will happen?ðŸ¤”

We are able to analyze patterns and variables in our environment that, once combined, allow us to know that something may happen.

- If you are running very fast without control? Will you fall if you take a mistake?

- If you have seen  **2 x 2** written so many times in a board? Will you able to guess that the answer is 4?

- If you start to get a headache and high body temperature? Are you able to guess that you are sick? 

Your brain has grown accustomed to looking at events and memorizing the factors that can lead to specific outcomes (i.e; If I see **2 x 2** written in a board I know the answer is 4). Similar to humans, machines are able to collect information, clean it, predict outcomes and improve their predictions based on the data they have.
