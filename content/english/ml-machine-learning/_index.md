Oh wow! Look at you wanting to get into the difficult stuff. Don't worry, we will guide you through the journey so that you can understand how it all works 😉. This workshop, gives you an introduction on machine learning and lets you understand the potential machine learning has once you have been able to master it. 

For context, **[Machine Learning](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/machine-learning-explained)** is the branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on using thousands, millions, billion or even trillions of data points alongside special algorithms that, once combined, let us predict outcomes. These special algorithms are designed to learn similarly to how humans learn. Little by little, they improve their accuracy and ultimately predict outcomes with lots of precision. (e.g:  Generate an image and text,  Recognize text, Predict behaviors, and more.)

One of the simplest ways to understand machine learning and get your hands dirty in the subject of **simple linear regression**. But before we jump in lets think about a couple of things for a second

- What do you have to do to improve a skill? 🤔

Repetition.

Always remember, "practice makes perfect". Similar to humans, machines can do the same.

- Why are you able to know that something will happen again? Or that something similar will happen? 🤔

Our brains are excellent when it comes to [recognizing patterns](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4141622/). We are able to identify the things in our environment that, once combined, allow us to know that something may happen again.

- If you are running very fast without control? Will you fall if you take a mistake?

- If you see  **2 * 2** written so many times ? Are you able to guess that the answer is 4?

- If you start to get a headache and high body temperature? Are you able to guess that you are sick?

Your brain has grown accustomed to looking at events and memorizing the factors that can lead to specific outcomes (i.e; If I see **2 * 2** written in a board I know the answer is 4). Similar to humans, machines are able to collect information, predict outcomes and improve their predictions based on historical data.
