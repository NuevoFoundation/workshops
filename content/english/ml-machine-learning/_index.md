Oh wow! Look at you wanting to get into the difficult stuff. Don't worry, we will guide you through the journey so that you can understand how it all works ðŸ˜‰. In this section, you'll find a introductory workshop that gives you an introductory workshop on machine learning.

For context, **Machine Learning** is the branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on using thousands, millions or even billion data points alongside special algorithms that, once combined, let us predict outcomes. These special algorithms are designed to learn similarly on humans learn. Little by little, they improve their accuracy and ultimately predict outcomes with lots of precision.

One of the simplest ways to understand machine learning and get your hands dirty in the subject is the topic of **simple linear regression**. But before we jump in let us think about it something for a second.
