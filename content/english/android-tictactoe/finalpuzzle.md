Now that Player 2 is no longer automatically winning the game and all the game pieces look good, there is still one last thing that is weird. Tic-Tac-Toe rules state that a player can win when the player has 3 pieces connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game works well for detection the horizontal and vertical wins, but something is wrong with the diagonal check.

Look for `// FINAL PUZZLE` in the `MainActivity.kt` file. Solve this puzzle to complete the game!
