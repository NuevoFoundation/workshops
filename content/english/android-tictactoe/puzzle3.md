## Puzzle 3a
This puzzle will test your knowledge about variables. There is something strange with one of the player's color on the board.

Find `// PUZZLE 3a` in the `MainActivity.kt` file and update the `colorGreen` variable to show green colored pieces on the board.

## Puzzle 3b
Why does Player 2 always win on the first move?! This doesn't make any sense, solve puzzle 3b to fix the game.

Find `// PUZZLE 3b` in the `MainActivity.kt` file and update the `winner` variable to ensure a player truly wins.

## Final Puzzle

Now that Player 2 is no longer automatically winning the game and all the game pieces look good, there is still one last thing that is weird. Tic-Tac-Toe rules state that a player can win when the player has 3 pieces connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game works well for detection the horizontal and vertical wins, but something is wrong with the diagonal check.

Look for `// FINAL PUZZLE` in the `MainActivity.kt` file. Solve this puzzle to complete the game!
