# Puzzle 3a
This puzzle will test your knowledge about variables. There is something strange with one of the player's color on the board.

Find `// PUZZLE 3a` in the `MainActivity.kt` file and update the `colorGreen` variable to show green colored pieces on the board.

# Puzzle 3b
Why does Player 2 always win on the first move?! This doesn't make any sense, solve puzzle 3b to fix the game.

Find `// PUZZLE 3b` in the `MainActivity.kt` file and update the `winner` variable to ensure a player truly wins.
