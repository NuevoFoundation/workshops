# Puzzle 2
Let's add a welcome message that the user can see when they start your app!

Go to **MainActivity.java** and find `// PUZZLE 2` in the code and write a toast that welcomes the user to your game with "Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe!”. Now press the play button (►) at the top of Android Studio and your app should look like this:

![Successful Toast](../resources/_gen/images/toast_success.PNG "successful toast")

{{% notice warning %}}
## HELP! I got a lot of red text!

If you see any red text, you have encountered some errors! Please ask for help. Beware of the following when coding in Java:

1. The `t` in `Toast` is capitalized.
2. Make sure the sentence you wish to show is surrounded in quotation marks, and that the parantheses are in the right place.
3. Do not delete any curly braces `{` or `}`.
