The computer can also do regular math that you see in school. Use `System.out.println` to print out the result from the math expressions.

```kotlin
System.out.println(5 + 4);
System.out.println(6 * (9 - 7) / 3);
```

Here is the full list of math symbols that you can use:

<table class="table">
            <tr>
                <td><code class="language-cs">+</code></td>
                <td>Add</td>
                <td><code class="language-cs">\</code></td>
                <td>Divide</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code class="language-cs">-</code></td>
                <td>Subtract</td>
                <td><code class="language-cs">%</code></td>
                <td>Modulo (remainder)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code class="language-cs">*</code></td>
                <td>Multiply</td>
                <td><code class="language-cs">(</code>,<code class="language-cs">)</code></td>
                <td>Parenthesis</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

**_Fun Fact: Computer Division_**

The computer does division differently from your regular calculator. Computer division will exclude remainders or decimals. For example, 15 / 4 produces 3, and not 3.75.

## Working Together

Try printing out the answers to the following to the console. Ensure your brackets are matched. Use a calculator (or mental math) to verify the computer produced the correct answer.

- 2 - 19
- (3 + 5) \* 6
- (13 + 5 \* 8) / (6 - (3 + 7))
- 3 % 2
