## Run the Game
Press the play button button (â–º) at the top of Android Studio and you'll see that the title at the top of the app says Toe-Tac-Tic (that doesn't seem right!), let's change it to Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Solve the Puzzle
Double-click the ```strings.xml``` file under res --> values:
<img src="../resources/_gen/images/puzzle1.png" height="30%" width="30%" title="Strings.xml location" alt="Image showing how to navigate toe strings.xml in Android Studio"/>

How can you modify this file to say Tic-Tac-Toe?
