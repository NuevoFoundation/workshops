## Run the Game
Press the play button button (►) at the top of Android Studio to start the game.

You'll see that the title at the top of the app says Toe-Tac-Tic (that doesn't seem right!); let's change it to Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Solve the Puzzle
Double-click the `strings.xml` file under app &rarr; res &rarr; values:
<img src="../resources/_gen/images/open_strings_file.gif" height="40%" width="40%" title="Strings.xml location" alt="Shows how to navigate toe strings.xml in Android Studio"/>

How can you modify this file to say Tic-Tac-Toe?
