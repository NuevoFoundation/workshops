# Run the Game
Press the play button button (►) at the top of Android Studio and you’ll see that the title at the top of the app says Toe-Tac-Tic (that doesn't seem right!), let's change it to Tic-Tac-Toe.

# Solve the Puzzle
Double-click the ```strings.xml``` file under res --> values:
![Strings.xml location](../resources/_gen/images/puzzle1.PNG)

How can you modify this file to say Tic-Tac-Toe?
