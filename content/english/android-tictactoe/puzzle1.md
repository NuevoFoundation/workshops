## Run the Game
Press the play button button (â–º) at the top of Android Studio to start the game.

## Solve the Puzzle
Double-click the `strings.xml` file under app &rarr; res &rarr; values:
<img src="../resources/_gen/images/open_strings_file.gif" height="30%" width="30%" title="Strings.xml location" alt="Shows how to navigate toe strings.xml in Android Studio"/>

How can you modify this file to say Tic-Tac-Toe?
