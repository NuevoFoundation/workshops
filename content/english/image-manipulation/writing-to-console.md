Let's start by doing a <font color="blue">print</font> statement. A <font color="blue">print</font> statement allows you to take control of the computer and make it print something out! 

To start, copy and paste this text into your Repl.it main.py:

```
print("Hello, World!")
```

Then, click run.

![alt text](../media/run.png "the run button")

Watch your console say "Hello, World!" on the screen to the right! <font color="blue">print</font> tells the computer to print the sentence within the parentheses `()` into the console window, or the screen on the right.

![alt text](../media/print.png "hello world in python!")

# HELP! I got a lot of red text!

If you see any red text, you have encountered some errors! Please ask for help or check the debugging page at the end of the tutorial. 

Some errors to be aware of:

1. You have to put quotes around the sentence you want to print!
    
    {{< icon name="remove" size="large" >}} <font color="blue">print</font>(`Hello, World!`)

    {{< icon name="ok" size="large" >}} <font color="blue">print</font>(`"Hello, World!"`)

2. Spacing is very important! 

    Make sure you don't have any extra tabs or spaces at the beginning or end of each line. 

    Python won't be able to read the code otherwise!
