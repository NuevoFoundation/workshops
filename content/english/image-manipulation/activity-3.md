Let's try to figure out the answers to the following using Python. Try printing out the result of the below (<b>make sure you don't miss any parentheses</b>):

- 2 - 19
- (3 + 5) * 6
- (13 + 5 * 8) / (6 - (3 + 7))

#### Challenge

Can you print out this statement? `"527 time 199 is: __"`

You will fill in the blank with the answer of what `(527 * 199)` is. If you want to print a string and a number together, you first have to convert the number into a string. 

Here's an example: <font color="blue">print</font>(`"Hello, World!"` + str(5))

{{% notice tip %}}

Using `str(5)` turns the number into the string `"5"`. Converting one type of thing to another is called "casting".

{{% /notice%}}

{{% notice info %}}
#### Fun Fact: Random Numbers

Here is how to print a random number between 1 (inclusive) and 10 (inclusive):

<font color="blue">from</font> random <font color="blue">import</font> randint

<font color="blue">print</font>(randint(1,10))

Want to know more? Ask for help or poke around on the internet! Every coder's best friend is a search engine! 

In particular, try understanding what the <font color="blue">from</font> and the <font color="blue">import</font> words mean. We will come back to these words later during the project.
