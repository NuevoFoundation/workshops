1. Without removing the quotation marks, try changing 
    ```
    "Hello, World!"
    ```
    to another sentence. For example, 

    ```
    "My name is Nuvi!"
    ```

    Press run to see if aything changes. 

2. Add another <font color="blue">print</font> below the current line to print a second sentence below the first. 

3. Press run to see if the two sentences print out

We will use printing a lot in the later lessons, so make sure you understand this before continuing!
