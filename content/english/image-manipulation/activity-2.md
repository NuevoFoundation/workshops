1. Start your code with the line <font color="blue">print</font>(`"Nuevo"` + `" "` + `"Foundation"`). If you run it, you should get the following output:
    
    `Nuevo Foundation`

2. Let's try and find two more ways to <font color="blue">print</font> the string `"Nuevo Foundation"` using two plus (+) symbols in each print statement.

    Once you make this work, you should have `"Nuevo Foundation"` printed out 3 times. In other words, your console should look like this after you press run:

    `Nuevo Foundation`

    `Nuevo Foundation`

    `Nuevo Foundation`

The strings that you combine do not have to be real words! For example, `"Ap" + "ple"` will produce the string `"Apple"`.
