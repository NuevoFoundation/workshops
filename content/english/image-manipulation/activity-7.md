Let’s try to create some simple math functions. Create a function called add that takes in two parameters, number1 and number2, and return the sum of the two numbers.

{{% notice tip %}}

First copy the structure of the triple function. Change the triple function name, and replace the parameter number with number1 and number2, separated with a comma. Both number1 and number2 should be <font color="blue">int</font>, and don’t forget to add number1 and number2 together!

{{% /notice %}}


To check that your function is working correctly, add the following code after your function definition, which calls the function add() and save its value in a variable. For example:

<pre>
value2 = add(2, 3)
<font color="blue">print</font>("This should print 5: " + str(value2))
</pre>

### Challenge
Can you create functions for subtraction, multiplication, and division? 

Test the functions out by calling each function, saving its return value, then printing it out to the console.
