If at any time during this activity, you wish to write notes to help you understand the code, you can use the `#` symbol to create a comment. 

Any text after the `#` symbol will be ignored by the
computer!

1. Try adding a comment above your first line of code and press run. You will see that the computer will ignore your comment.

Be careful, if you remove the `#` symbol, your code will not work!
