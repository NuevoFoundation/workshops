First of all let's load Flappy and put it on the screen.

Add below command in the file [File: load-sprites.js]
       game.load.image('bird','assets/bird.png');

## Working Together

In the repl.it window below, we started the code with the line `game.load.image('bird', 'assets/bird.png');`.

![alt text](../img/loadbird.png "image to add the bird in the file")

In your console you should see a Jsappy bird after you press **run**:
