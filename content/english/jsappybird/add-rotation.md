Let's add rotation to the bird:

Add below command in the file [File: update-game.js]
    if (bird.angle < 50) {
       bird.angle += 1;
    }

## Comments:

`If` is a conditional block where we are checking the angle of the bird and if it's less than 50 we are executing the condition.
   -bird.angle+=1;

## Working Together

In the repl.it window below, we started the code with the line `bird.angle +=1;`.

In your console you should see a Jsappy bird rotating with an angle after you press **run**:
