### What should we do with the bird?

Let's make him jump:

Add below command in the file [File: create-game.js]
     spaceKey.onDown.add(jump, this);

### Working Together

In the Replit window below, we started the code with the line `spaceKey.onDown.add(jump, this);`.

In your console you should see a Jsappy bird jumping after you press **run**:

## Add gravity
### Working Together

In the Replit window below, we started the code with the line `bird.body.gravity.y = 900;`.
