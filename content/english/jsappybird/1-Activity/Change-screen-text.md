Let's change the start screen text:

     Add below command in the file [File: start-screen.js]
     var text = game.add.text(0, 0, "Press Space to Start", textOptions);


## Working Together

In the repl.it window below, we started the code with the line `var text = game.add.text(0, 0, "Press Space to Start", textOptions);`.

 In  your console you should see Press Space to Start after you press **run**:
