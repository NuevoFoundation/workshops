Let's add gravity to the bird:

Add below command in the file [File: create-game.js]
    bird.body.gravity.y = 900;


## Working Together

In the repl.it window below, we started the code with the line `bird.body.gravity.y = 900;`.

In your console you should see a JSappy bird jumping with gravity after you press **run**:
