### Make notes while you are coding

**Comments** are the parts of the code that do not get evaluated. In Python, they are preceded by the `#` symbol. Anything after the `#` symbol is part of the comment and is ignored by your code. Comments are put in the code to tell the readers what the code is doing. They can make maintenance of code easy and can also help in finding bugs.
