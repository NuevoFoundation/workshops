Booleans are <font color="blue">True</font> or <font color="blue">False</font> statements. Unlike strings or numbers, <b>booleans</b> store statements of truth: is what I'm saying true or false? 

For example, if I say, "You are a robot", a boolean can store whether this statement is true. In this case, since you are not a robot (hopefully!), <font color="blue">False</font> would be stored. 

What are the boolean answers to these questions about you?

1. I am a human. _______
2. I have 25 fingers. _______
3. I like cookies. _______
4. My favorite color is blue. ______


| Operator | Description           | Operator | Description              |
| -------- | --------------------- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| `<`      | Less than             | `>`      | Greater than             |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to | `>=`     | Greater than or equal to |
| `==`     | Equal to              | `!=`     | Not equal to             |


As usual, use <font color="blue">print</font> to print out your results to the following:

<pre>
    <font color="blue">print</font>(5 + 8 < 10)
    <font color="blue">print</font>((3 + 5) * 6) == (65 - 17)
</pre>

The first statement should return <font color="blue">False</font>. And the second should return <font color="blue">True</font>.
