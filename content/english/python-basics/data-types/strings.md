Anything that is surrounded by quotation marks is called a `string`. This is how a computer represents words or sentences. For example, "a", "2", "banana!", and "Hello World" are strings, but 2 and Hello World are not strings, because the quotation marks are missing. You can combine many strings together using the `+` sign!

For example,

- `"Apple" + "Pineapple"` produces the string `"ApplePineapple"`

- `"Nuevo" + " " + "Foundation"` produces `"Nuevo Foundation"`


#### Challenge

What if you combine your first and last name? How would you do that?
