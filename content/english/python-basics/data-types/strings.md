Anything that is surrounded by quotation marks is called a `string`. This is how a computer represents words or sentences. For example, "a", "2", "banana!", and "Hello World" are strings, but 2 and Hello World are not strings, because the quotation marks are missing. You can combine many strings together using the `+` sign!

The strings that you combine do not have to be real words! For example, `"Ap" + "ple"` will produce the string `"Apple"`.

For example,

- `"Apple" + "Pineapple"` produces the string `"ApplePineapple"`

- `"Nuevo" + " " + "Foundation"` produces `"Nuevo Foundation"`


#### Challenge 1

What if you combine your first and last name? How would you do that? 

#### Challenge 2

Delete all the `print` statements in your code. Start your code with the line `print("Nuevo" + " " + "Foundation")`

If you run it, you should get the following output:

    Nuevo Foundation

Letâ€™s try and find two more ways to print the string `"Nuevo Foundation"` using two plus (`+`) symbols in each `print` statement. Once you make this work, you should have "Nuevo Foundation" printed out 3 times. In other words, your console should look like this after you press run:

    Nuevo Foundation
    Nuevo Foundation
    Nuevo Foundation
