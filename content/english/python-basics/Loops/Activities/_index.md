1. Using a `for` loop or `while` loop, try printing the following pattern
```
1 
1 2 
1 2 3 
1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 4 5
```

2. Given a large list such as the one below, write a program that can find a particular number from this list.
For example, ask the user to enter a number in the console, then write to console if it was found.

How would you change this program if the list is very large?  If you've found a number, do you need to continue searching the rest of the list?
