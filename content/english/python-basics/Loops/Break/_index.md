You learned earlier that for loops and while loops keep iterating over a sequence until it reaches the end or until a condition is met.

There is another way to stop running these loops before the end of the list or before a condition is met.

You can do this with the break statement.  This lets you break out of the loop in either a for loop or while loop.  

Here's an example with a while loop:
