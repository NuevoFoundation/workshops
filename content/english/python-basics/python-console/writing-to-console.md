### Make your program talk to you!

**Print** statements are used to print something on the console. Use `print("Hello World")` to print *Hello World* in the output screen. We will later learn that print is a function and we use it to perform a print job. Whatever you pass to the `print` function is printed on the screen.
Let's start by doing a <font color="blue">print</font> statement. A <font color="blue">print</font> statement allows you to take control of the computer and make it print something out! 

To start, write `print("Hello, World!")` text into your Repl.it main.py and click Run.

Watch your console say "Hello, World!" on the screen to the right! <font color="blue">print</font> tells the computer to print the sentence within the parentheses `()` into the console window, or the screen on the right.

# HELP! I got a lot of red text!

If you see any red text, you have encountered some errors! Please ask for help or check the debugging page at the end of the tutorial. 

Some errors to be aware of:

1. You have to put quotes around the sentence you want to print!
    
    {{< icon name="remove" size="large" >}} <font color="blue">print</font>(`Hello, World!`)

    {{< icon name="ok" size="large" >}} <font color="blue">print</font>(`"Hello, World!"`)

2. Spacing is very important! 

    Make sure you don't have any extra tabs or spaces at the beginning or end of each line. 

    Python won't be able to read the code otherwise!
