We will ignore some of the details on this screen, but we will go over some of the basics that show up. The `main.py` file contains code, or instructions for the computer to run. Anything that results from running the code will be displayed on the right side. This window is called the console.

Hit **run** and watch your console run your code on the screen to the right! In the example below, `print` tells the computer to print the sentence within the parentheses `()` into the console, or the screen on the right. Learn more about `print` in the next lessons.
