Open your favorite internet browser (such as Edge, Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer) and go to https://replit.com. Scroll to the bottom of the page, look for `languages`, search for Python and click it.

You should see something like the following screen:

Before we start, letâ€™s first understand how the window works. The `main.py` file contains code, or instructions for the computer to run. Anything that results from running the code will be displayed on the right side. This window is called the console.

Hit **run** and watch your console run your code on the screen to the right! In the example below, `print` tells the computer to print the sentence within the parentheses `()` into the console, or the screen on the right. Learn more about `print` in the next lessons.

Note: The RUN button looks like this:
