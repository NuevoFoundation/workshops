### Make your program talk to you!

**Print** statements are used to print something on the console. Use `print("Hello World")` to print *Hello World* in the output screen. We will later learn that print is a function and we use it to perform a print job. Whatever you pass to the `print` function is printed on the screen.
Let's start by doing a `print` statement. A `print` statement allows you to take control of the computer and make it print something out! 

We will use printing a lot in the later lessons, so make sure you understand this before moving on to the next concept!

### Challenge 1
To start, write the following text into your Replit main.py and click Run.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Watch your console say "Hello, World!" on the screen to the right! `print` tells the computer to print the sentence within the parentheses `()` into the console window, or the screen on the right.

### Challenge 2

1. Without removing the quotation marks, try changing `"Hello, World"` to another sentence. (For example – `"My name is Nuvi!"`) Press **run** to see if anything changes.
2. Add another print below the current line to print a second sentence below the first sentence.
3. Press **run** to see if two sentences are printed out.

## HELP! I got a lot of red text!

If you see any red text, you have encountered some errors! Please ask for help. In particular, beware of the following when coding in Python:

1. Make sure the sentence you wish to print is **surrounded in quotation marks** and that the sentence is **inside the parentheses**.

2. Spacing in Python is very important. Make sure you don’t have any unnecessary spaces or tabs at the beginning or at the end of each line, as Python won’t be able to read the code otherwise. For example, don’t put any spaces before `print`, or any spaces after the last parenthesis in `print("Hello, World!)`.
