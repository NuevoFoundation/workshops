Today, we'll be using Trinket to learn about Python. Here is an example of an interactive Trinket window you will be using today.

Before we start, letâ€™s first understand how the window works. The `main.py` file contains code, or instructions for the computer to run. Anything that results from running the code will be displayed on the right side. This window is called the console.

Hit **run** and watch your console run your code on the screen to the right! In the example below, `print` tells the computer to print the sentence within the parentheses `()` into the console, or the screen on the right. Learn more about `print` in the next lessons.
