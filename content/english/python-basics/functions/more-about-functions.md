Suppose you have many lines of code, and you would like to give this section of code a meaningful name. <b>Functions</b> are blocks of code that do just that. A function is a set of instructions that we give to the computer to store, and it can take in <b>parameters</b> (input data) and output data. A function in Python looks like this:

```python
def my_function():
    print("Hello World!")
    print("My name is Nuvi!")
```

Let‚Äôs analyze this piece of code. The `def` tells the computer that you are writing a function. We give it a name, in this case, `my_function`. Then, we put a colon (the `:` symbol) to indicate that the function is starting. The next two lines are **two spaces away from the left side of the text editor** -- this tells the computer that these lines are part of the function definition. This is **very important**, so don't miss out on this detail!

Press run.

You will notice that nothing happens. This is only a function definition - we need to ‚Äúcall‚Äù the function to run the code within the function. In other words, the computer understands the instructions, but you need to tell the computer to do the given instructions. You can call `my_function()` anywhere, as long as it is after the function is defined. Place `my_function()` below the function definition, with no spaces in front. Your code should look like this:
 

```python
def my_function():
    print("Hello World!")
    print("My name is Nuvi!")

my_function()
```

{{% notice note %}}

Don't forget to remove the two spaces before calling my_function(). You might run into unexpected behavior otherwise! 

{{% /notice %}}

## Writing Math Functions ##
You might be familiar with the math definition of a function; for example,
the function ùíá(ùíô) = 3ùíô. It takes an input value, ùíô, and transforms the value by multiplying it by 3. Similarly, in python, you can also give input values (called <b>parameters</b>) to a function and <font color="blue">return</font> (or produce) an output value. An example of a Python function which triples a given
number is given below:

```python
def triple(number):
    return number *3

value = triple(2)
print(value)
```
`number` is the name of the parameter (input) that we are giving to the function triple. The `return` word is only used within functions, and allows the function to output a value. In this case the triple function returns (outputs) `number * 3`, which then can be stored in a variable and printed. If the function variable. Check that the code above prints out the number `6`.
