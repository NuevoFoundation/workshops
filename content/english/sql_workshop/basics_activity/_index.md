# Cadet Training!
As a new honorary space explorer, let's go over some basics!

## What Is A Database?

 It is a type of container for you to hold and organize information. 
Think of a database like a bucket where you can place toys in so they don’t get lost 
and you can easily find them later. This bucket might hold smaller buckets to sort 
your toys.

## What is SQL?

SQL stands for “Structured Query Language” and like its name, 
it is a language that lets you talk to the database to get the information 
you need. A SQL command is like a sentence you say to the database.
