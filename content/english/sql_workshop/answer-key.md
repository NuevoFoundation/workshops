Note: Do not use Firefox Browser for this workshop!

For Drag and Drop Activities: Correctly chosen blocks will have a green highlight around them while incorrect blocks will highlight in red until the player moves the block.

For Type-In Activities: Correct words/commands will be highlighted in green in the Previous Command Box, incorrectly placed or misused words will be highlighted in red. If the command players write matches the answer key and it still highlights in red, make sure there are no extra spaces at the end or beginning of the command! Make sure players have a semicolon at the end of the command (The last word in the SQL command will highlight red if there is no semicolon)! Note that some of the kids copy a sample command from the workshop and paste it in the terminal to run - this will not work! Please ask them to refresh the page and manually type in the command.

SQL keywords (reserved words) in the commands are case insensitive (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, COUNT, MAX, IN, etc.), but are often written in caps to differentiate from non-keywords. "select * from planet" is same as "SELECT * FROM planet".

### Learn Cadet Basics
**No activity, only a read through of terminology.**

### Activity 1: Learn the SELECT Command (Drag and Drop)
Answer: `SELECT * FROM galaxy;`

### Activity 2: Learn the WHERE Command (Drag and Drop)
Answer: `SELECT * FROM galaxy WHERE name = ‘Planet of Fun’;`

### Explain Syntax
**No activity, only an explanation of the SQL Command format.**

### Activity 3: 
Two Valid Answers:
`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM planet;` OR `SELECT COUNT(city_number) FROM planet;`

### Activity 4: Select Multiple Info (Type-in)
Two Valid Answers: `SELECT planet, leader FROM galaxy;` OR `SELECT leader, planet FROM galaxy;`

The only difference between the two answers is the order of columns displayed, therefore both answers are valid.

### Activity 5: Learn the MAX/MIN Command (Both Type-In + Drag and Drop)
Valid Answers: 
* `SELECT MAX(height) FROM items WHERE object IN (‘ladder’);` 
* `SELECT MAX(height) FROM items WHERE object = 'ladder';`
* `SELECT * FROM items WHERE object IN (‘ladder’);`
* `SELECT * FROM items WHERE object = 'ladder';`
Although the third and fourth answers do not use the MAX command, it displays all the ladders and their colors, making this a valid answer for the activity.

Answers for Bonus:
* `SELECT MAX(height) FROM items WHERE object NOT IN('totem', 'key');`
* `SELECT MAX(height) FROM items WHERE object NOT IN('totem');`
* `SELECT MAX(height) FROM items WHERE object NOT IN('key');`
If players use `NOT IN` correctly, this will still output the correct answer.

Drag and Drop: The correct ladder to drag and drop is the RED ladder (rightmost ladder). The correct ladder will highlight in green.

### Activity 6: Use Comparators (Type-In)
Answer: `SELECT * FROM items WHERE date_created = ‘1738-09-12’;`

Bonus Answer: `SELECT * FROM items WHERE date_created >= ‘1738-09-12’;`

### Activity 7: Use the MIN Command (Type-In + Drag and Drop)
Valid Answers: 
* `SELECT MIN(height) FROM items WHERE object IN (‘key’);` 
* `SELECT * FROM items WHERE object IN('key');`
* `SELECT MIN(height) FROM items WHERE object = 'key';`
* `SELECT * FROM items WHERE object = 'key';`
* `SELECT MIN(height) FROM items WHERE object NOT IN('totem', 'ladder');`
* `SELECT MIN(height) FROM items WHERE object NOT IN('totem');`
* `SELECT MIN(height) FROM items WHERE object NOT IN('ladder');`

Drag and Drop: The height corresponds to the number of loops on the base of the key. The smallest key (height of 1) is the correct key to drag and drop (rightmost key).

### Activity 8: Learn the LIKE Command (Type-In)
Two Valid Answers: `SELECT * FROM items WHERE date_created LIKE ‘%-10-%’;` OR `select * from items where date_created like '1738-10-%';`

### Activity 9: Learn the AVG Command (Type-In)
Answer: `SELECT AVG(population) FROM planet;`

The combination to the safe is "40".

### Activity 10: Learn the SUM Command (Type-In)
Answer: `SELECT SUM(population) FROM planet;`

### Activity 11: Learn the GROUP BY Command (Type-In)
Answer: `SELECT * FROM planet GROUP BY favorite_food;`

Bonus Answer: `SELECT COUNT(*), favorite_food FROM planet GROUP BY favorite_food;`

The correct buttons to select (in any order) are: pizza, hotdog, hamburger, and taco.

### Activity 12: Find the Inventor! (Type-In)
Answer: `SELECT * FROM people;`

The inventor: "Dr. Phi"
