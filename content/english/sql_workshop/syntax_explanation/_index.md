# An email from the Galactic Federation?
In the middle of your journey, you suddenly receive a message from the Galactic Federation. What could it be about?

<br/>

Sender: The Galactic Federation

Receiver: Space Cadet

Subject: Upgraded Terminal

<br/>

Dear Space Cadet,

<br/>

Our records have indicated that you have learned enough commands to learn the basic structure for SQL commands.
**The Galactic Federation has taken notice of your achievements and has decided to bestow upon you an upgraded terminal!**
During your journey, you will need your handy-dandy terminal to display information about the planet around. Now you are able to type in commands!

<br/>

As per the Space Explorer Guidelines, we will now debrief you on the core structure of a SQL 
command in hopes that you will be able to overcome the challenges that have yet to come.

<!--{{%notice warning%}}
* Column and database names are **case sensitive**, this means that if the names are all lower-case, please make sure they are lower-case when you type them!
* Please don't forget the semicolon at the end of a SQL command!

Hopefully our advice will help you in your journey. Good Luck, Space Cadet!

<br/>

Wishing You The Best Adventure,

<br/>

The Galactic Federation
