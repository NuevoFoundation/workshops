# An Email from the Galactic Federation?
In the middle of your journey, you suddenly receive a message from the Galactic Federation. What did they send you?

<br/>

Sender: The Galactic Federation

Receiver: Space Cadet

Subject: Upgraded Terminal

<br/>

Dear Space Cadet,

<br/>

Our records have indicated that you have learned enough commands to understand the basic structure for SQL commands.
**The Galactic Federation has taken notice of your achievements and has decided to bestow upon you an upgraded terminal!**
On your journey, you will need your handy-dandy terminal to display information about the planet around you and you are now able to type in commands. 

<br/>

As per the Space Explorer Guidelines, we will now debrief you on the core structure of a SQL 
command in hopes that you will be able to overcome challenges that have yet to come.

Hopefully our advice will help you along your journey. Good luck Space Cadet!

<br/>

Wishing You The Best Adventure,

<br/>

The Galactic Federation
