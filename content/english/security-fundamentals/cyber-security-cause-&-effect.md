Cyber security in practice is more than just not falling for scams online. What exactly are the common risks that users online ignore and that hackers take advantage of?  

Not enabling two-factor authentication to log into accounts (social media, banking, gaming, etc.) 

This makes it much easier for hackers to crack your password and log in without you knowing. 

2. Password reuse (using the same password for many sites) 

Once your password is discovered, a hacker will likely be able to access more or all your accounts online.
