     <li>Avoid leaving sensitive information in places that are not secure (written down, plain documents, notes apps)</li>
     <li>Turn on sign in notifications and things like two factor authentication</li>
     <li>Be careful when opening suspicious links in emails and text messages</li>
     <li>Make sure to keep your devices updated to the most recent software versions</li>
