# Getting Started

## How to edit workshop content from GitHub

**Scenario**: Let's make a simple change to the Contributor Guidelines page and submit a pull request.

### Find the markdown page on the website
Open the [Workshop Contributor Guidelines](https://workshops.nuevofoundation.org/guidelines/) page, scroll to the bottom and click the "Edit on GitHub" hyperlink.

### Open the File editor 
Click the pencil icon on the page which should open [Edit File page](https://github.com/NuevoFoundation/workshops/edit/master/content/guidelines/_index.md). 

From here you can toggle between the `Edit file` tab to edit the content and the `Preview changes` tab for a rough preview of how the page would be rendereed. 

### Make a change 
From here, you can make a change to the page, say by adding two exclamation points to the word "Welcome!"

**Before**: `Welcome!`

**After**: `Welcome!!!`

### Commit the change 
At the bottom of the page, you will see the **Commit changes** section. Set the following values:

* **Title**: `Update index.md` Default, no change needed
* **Extended Description**: For our example, we will say: `this is a test PR, you can safely delete` 
* **Select**: `Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request`

Finally, click the **Propose file change** button to create your pull request. 

### Review your pull request
Once created, go to the [Pull Requests](https://github.com/NuevoFoundation/workshops/pulls) tab to load your pull request.
