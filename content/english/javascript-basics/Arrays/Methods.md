To make things easier, arrays provide a lot of methods. Let's go over some of the basic ones which would give you an idea of they look like.



# Concat() 
Joins two or more arrays and returns a new array.

# Reverse() 
Transposes the elements of an array, in place: the first array element becomes the last and the last becomes the first. It returns a reference to the array.
