# What is an Array?

An array is simply a collection of values. It's a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

For example, consider an array called fruits, which would contain values like apple, orange, mango etc... all together in a single variable.   



# How to create one

The following statements show how to create arrays in two different ways but the end result is the same.

<b>Syntax:</b>
```javascript
var arrayName = new Array(element0, element1, ..., elementN);
var arrayName = Array(element0, element1, ..., elementN);
var arrayName = [element0, element1, ..., elementN];
```
