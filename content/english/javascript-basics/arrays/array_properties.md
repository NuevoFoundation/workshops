Array properties or characteristics are a way to describe the attributes of the array. Examples include: the total number of elements, the value at a particular index, etc...

Here is a list of the properties of the Array object along with their description.


# Constructor() 
Returns a reference to the array function that created the object.

<b>Syntax:</b>
```javascript
arrayName.constructor;
```

<b>Example:</b>
![#Can't find image](../../img/arrayproperties/constructor.png)


# Index() 
The property represents the zero-based index of the match in the string. Index provides a way to access or modify elements based on their position in the array.

### Access an array element by index:

<b>Syntax:</b>
```javascript
var value = arrayName[index];
```

<b>Example:</b>
![#Can't find image](../../img/arrayproperties/indexaccess.png)


### Modify an array element by index:

<b>Syntax:</b>
```javascript
arrayName[index] = newValue;
```

<b>Example:</b>
![#Can't find image](../../img/arrayproperties/indexmodify.png)


# Length() 
Reflects the number of elements in an array.

<b>Syntax:</b>
```javascript
var length = arrayName.length;
```

<b>Example:</b>
![#Can't find image](../../img/arrayproperties/length.png)
