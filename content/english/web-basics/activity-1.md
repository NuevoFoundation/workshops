## Activity 1 - Creating a basic website

It's now time to start building a basic website. To complete this activity, you will need to complete the following steps:

1. Open the web editor (click the "Try it yourself!" button below)
2. Use the header tags to add a title, and the paragraph tags to write a paragraph about Benji
3. If you have time: write a list of Benji's favorite treats: turkey, peanut butter, and string cheese

Use this reference chart to try some HTML tags on your own.

Tag | Description | Example
---|--------------|----------
`<html></html>`                         | Describes an HTML Document. Any website must start with the <html> opening tag and end with the </html> closing tag. | See the Code Pen example above. 
`<!-- -->`                              | Describes a comment. Comments are meant for other coders to see but they are not displayed on the website. |`<!-- This line will not show in the browser -->`
`<head></head>`                         | Contains all the HTML elements that give information to the browser to display the website correctly. The HTML elements between <head> and </head> tag are not displayed. | See the Code Pen example above
`<title></title>`                       | Contains the title of the website to be used for naming the browser tab. | &lt;head&gt;<br>&lt;title&gt; My Website &lt;/title&gt;<br>&lt;/head&gt;
`<body></body>`                         | Contains all the HTML elements that are displayed in the page like text and pictures. | See the Code Pen example above.
`<h1></h1>`<br> ... <br> `<h6></h6>`    | Defines a heading/title. &lt;h1&gt; defines the most important (largest) heading/title, while &lt;h6&gt; defines the least important (smallest) heading. | &lt;h1&gt;This will be a big title&lt;/h1&gt;<br> &lt;h4&gt;This will be a smaller title&lt;/h4&gt;
`<p></p>`                               | Describes a paragraph. | &lt;p&gt;Dogs evolved to love humans. In conclusion, dogs are a human’s best friend.&lt;/p&gt;
`<div></div>`                           | Defines a division or section on the site. | &lt;div&gt;<br>&lt;h1&gt;All about me&lt;/h1&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;
`<img>`                                 | An image. It’s a self-closing tag but you must specify the source of the image for the browser to know where to get the image from. | &lt;img src="aka.ms/Benji-the-dog"&gt;
`<hr>`                                  | Draws a horizontal line. Another self-closing tag that’s useful if you want to break up the page’s content. | ... <br> &lt;hr&gt; <br> ...
`<ul>`<br>`<li>`<br>`</li>`<br>`</ul>`  | A list. To start the list, use a &lt;ul&gt; tag. For each item to be added to the list, surround the item with the &lt;li&gt; and &lt;/li&gt;tags. Finish the list with the &lt;/ul&gt; tag. | &lt;ul&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;This is a list item.&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;/ul&gt;
