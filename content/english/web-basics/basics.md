## What is a website?

A website is just a page that can be found on the Internet. It is displayed through a browser when you type the address (aka unique name) in the address bar.

### Website design

The first step in making a website is to decide which elements we want, and how they will look.

This sketch is just a guideline. It’s okay to change things around as we start putting it together. A good rule of thumb is to start as simple as possible.
