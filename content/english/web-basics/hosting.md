## Host your site on the internet!

Now that you've created your own personal website, let's host it on the internet so everyone can access it! You will need a GitHub account to do so. If you don't have one, create one [here](https://github.com/).

Once you have created your account and verified your email address, you will land on this page.

Now, you will need to create a new repository to store the contents of your site! Think of a repository as a giant folder that can store lots of other files and folders for a given project. You can create one by selecting `Start a Project` or `Create a new repository`. Two very important things to keep in mind:

1. Name your repo <b>without any spaces</b>. But you can use dashes or capitalization to replicate spaces!
2. <b>Check the box `Initialize this repository with a README`</b>

<b>Congratulations!</b> You have created your first repo! Upload all your files and folders that belong to your site here. Now, when you go to your profile page, your new Repository will now show up under Repositories.

After you've uploaded everything you created for your site, navigate back to the repo and select Settings.

<p style="text-align: center; "><img src="../media/firstRepo.png" alt="first repo on github" width="750"/></p>

Scroll all the way down to the GitHub Pages section.

<p style="text-align: center; "><img src="../media/pages.png" alt="github pages section on page" width="800"/></p>

Change the <b>Source</b> from 'None' to 'main branch'. Save these changes and click the link at the top of the GitHub Pages section (in the example below, it would be https://exampleaccount1234.github.io/myFirstSite/). Now anyone can access your site with this link!
