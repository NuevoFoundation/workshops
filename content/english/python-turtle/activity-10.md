We’ve successfully set the color of the mandala flower to an RGB value. Now, let's explore changing the color of the individual mandala flower petals? 

We will make use of python’s `random` library. The `random.randint()` method allows us to choose a random value for each of the red, green, or blue value. To choose a value that is between 0 inclusive and 256 exclusive (in other words, between 0 and 255 inclusive), we need to use `random.randint(0, 256)`.

Use `random.randint(0, 256)` three times to produce three random values, and plug them into the `turtle.color()` method. You should now be able to see a multi-colored mandala flower! This is definitely a flower from which Alex would be interested in collecting nectar!

Congratulations! You helped Alex make a honeycomb and a flower! He can now happily live in his beehive, and make lots of honey! Your final image should look something like this:
