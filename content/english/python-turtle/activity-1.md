Kudos! You helped Alex draw a line! Now letâ€™s step it up and help Alex draw a square. To draw a square, we need to follow these steps:

1. Go forward for 50 steps
2. Turn left by 90 degrees
3. Go forward for 50 steps
4. Turn left by 90 degrees
5. Go forward for 50 steps
6. Turn left by 90 degrees
7. Go forward for 50 steps

Remember to use `turtle.forward()` to draw lines. To turn 90 degrees left, you need to pass `90` as the argument to the `turtle.left()` method:

```
turtle.left(90)
```
