We’re done creating our first figure 8! We can now use the `figure_8()` function to create a mandala flower! A mandala flower is many figure 8s placed on top of each other at different angles. So, to do this we need to use a... you guessed it, a loop!

Create a new function called `mandala_flower()`. In the loop we will call the `figure_8()` function we wrote earlier to create a figure 8. Then, rotate the turtle either left or right a certain number of degrees (for example, 10 degrees). Repeat these steps many times to make a mandala flower; it’s a good idea to create a loop that repeats at least 35 times.
