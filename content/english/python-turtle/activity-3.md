Great job! You just drew your first shape in Python with Turtle! Now letâ€™s slightly change the code we already wrote to draw a square to instead draw a hexagon. Alex is a bee, after all, and he needs to draw hexagons to build his first honeycomb.

To help you draw a hexagon, think of how many sides a hexagon has. How many degrees are in each angle of a hexagon?

As a helpful reminder, this is the code that was used to create a triangle:

```
for i in range(3):
  turtle.forward(50)
  turtle.left(120)
```
