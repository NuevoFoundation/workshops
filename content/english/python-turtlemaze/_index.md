Welcome to **The Tale of Nuvo and Nuvi: The Great Maze Adventure!** 🐢✨  

Once upon a time, in a bright green meadow, two curious robot turtles — **Nuvo** and **Nuvi** — loved exploring, racing to the pond, and playing hide-and-seek under tall flowers.  

One sunny afternoon, Nuvi spotted a mysterious maze nearby. She giggled and said,  
> “Let’s make hide-and-seek even more fun! I’ll hide inside the maze, and you come find me!”  

Nuvi scurried inside... but soon disappeared behind twisty paths and secret corners. Now it’s up to **you and Nuvo** to use your Python turtle powers to navigate the maze, one line of code at a time, and bring Nuvi safely back! 💛  

Are you ready to begin your coding quest?

Together, we’ll learn how to:
- 🎨 Draw with the **Turtle** module  
- 🌀 Move, turn, and explore using code  
- 💡 Build a maze step by step  
- 🧩 Use buttons and shapes  
- 🥳 Guide Nuvo to rescue Nuvi at the end!  

Grab your keyboard, brave explorer — the maze awaits! 🌿
