## Task 1: Find the average cost!

Suppose we have an array containing the costs of various foods. Find the average cost of the food!

{{%notice tip%}}
1. You can use a `for` loop to go through the array!
2. Remember, the average of a list is the total divided by the number of items
{{%/notice%}}

## Task 2: Sorting an array!

The cost of each item in the menu is all over the place! Help us sort the array from least to greatest.

{{%notice tip%}}
1. Think of a way to sort the array (there are many different ways to do so)!
2. Look at the example!
{{%/notice%}}

If we are given this array below, 
```js javascript
int[] cost = {100,90,50,60,20,1,3};
```

we should get the following output:
```js javascript
int[] sorted = {1,3,20,50,60,90,100};
```

## Task 3: Make your own array! (optional)

Now it's your turn! Input your own elements into the array!
