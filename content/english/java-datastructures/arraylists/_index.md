Now that the customers have access to all the items on the menu, it’s time for them to place their orders. A customer may want to add an item to their order, remove an item, change an item, or access an item. After finalizing the order, you would want to return a receipt containing the number of items that the customer ordered, as well as each item in a list for the customer to checkout. We will accomplish all these feats utilizing an `ArrayList`.
