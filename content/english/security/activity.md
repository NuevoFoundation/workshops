Let's play a game!

<form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="https://formkeep.com/f/exampletoken" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="utf8" value="✓">
  Write your favorite sentence in the text box below. Make sure it has at least five words. (E.g. I like playing volleyball at the beach.)
  <input type="email"  name="email" placeholder="Your Favorite sentence.">
</br>
   Now take the first letter of each word from the above sentence and write inside the text box. (E.g. ilpvatb)
  <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="The first letter of each word">
</br>
   Add some numbers to the text. Remember the position of the numbers. (E.g. 1ilpvatb6)
  <input type="tel" name="phone" placeholder="Add some numbers">
</br>
  Finally, let's add some special characters to the text. (E.g. 1ilpv$atb6)
  <input type="tel" name="phone" placeholder="Add a special character">

</br>
</form>

### Voilà that's your new password! Doesn't it look hard to crack?
