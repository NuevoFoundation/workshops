Meet our friend **Bob**, he has a "SECRET" that he doesn’t want to share. It is 
locked somewhere safe. Only Bob has the key to the lock.

Meet our not so good friend **Eve**, they want access to **Bob**’s secret.
**Eve** has been spying on **Bob**. They realize **Bob** loves his pet dog "Max".

They figure out the key to his lock which is *I love Max* and voila **Eve** 
finds out Bob’s “SECRET”.

Well we don’t want that.
