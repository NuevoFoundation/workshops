Meet our friend **Bob**. **Bob** has a secret that he doesn’t want to share, he 
would like to keep it secured. He has the secret locked somewhere safe. Only 
Bob has the `key` to the lock to make sure that no one can get to his secret
but him.

Meet our not so good friend **Eve**. **Eve** wants access to **Bob**’s secret.

**Eve** realizes that to get to **Bob**'s secret, they need to first get past
**Bob**'s lock. **Eve** can't break the lock, but maybe she can figure out the
`key`. After spying on **Bob** for a while, **Eve** realizes that he really 
loves his pet dog, Max. This gives **Eve** an idea.

**Eve** thinks that, since **Bob** loves his pet so much, he might have decided
to make that the `key` to his lock. They decide to give it a try, and *violà*, 
**Eve** was able to open **Bob**'s lock and see his secret.

This is not good for **Bob**! He wants to know what he could have done
differently so that **Eve** couldn't break his lock so easily, but he doesn't
know where to start.

Luckily for **Bob**, his good friend Secret Agent **Alice** arrives to help
him out with his situation. Let's see what **Alice** has to say...
