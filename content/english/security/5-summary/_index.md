#### Remember the characteristics of a strong password are:

1. At least 8 characters - the more characters, the better
2. A mixture of letters and numbers
3. Inclusion of at least one special character, e.g., ! @ # ? ]
*Note: do not use < or > in your password, as both can cause problems in Web browsers*

A strong password is hard to guess, but it should be easy for you to remember - a password that has to be written down is not strong, no matter how many of the above characteristics are employed.


### Solution

In the Spy Game the passwords "Ilovesoccer" and "12345678" are weak and can be easily hacked by a malicious person.
