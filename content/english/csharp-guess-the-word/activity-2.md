# Activity 2

Find `// TODO (ACTIVITY 2)` in the GuessTheWord code. For the Guess the Word game, we will give the computer a word bank, and the computer will choose one of the words randomly to use for the game. So far, we have added the words `"Hello"` and `"World"` to the word bank. However, a Guess the Word game with only two possible words to guess is not fun at all! Add at least 3 more strings to the word bank.

**_Note:_** The console output will not change from the previous activity. We do not want to tell the player the words inside the word bank when they play the game! For this activity, just make sure that you do not get any error messages in the console after pressing **run**.
