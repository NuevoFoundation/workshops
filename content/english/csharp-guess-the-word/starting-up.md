## Starting Up

The goal of today's activity is to learn C# skills and incorporate your new-found knowledge to create a Guess The Word game! Let's get the game set up.

Open your favorite internet browser (such as Edge, Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer), and go to <a href="https://aka.ms/nuevoguesstheword" target="_blank">https://aka.ms/nuevoguesstheword</a>. Your screen should look like this:

We will ignore some of the details on this screen, but we will go over some of the basics that show up. The `main.cs` file contains code, or instructions for the computer to run. By pressing the **run** button, you tell the computer to perform the instructions in the code. Any results from running the code will be displayed on the right side, called the **console**.

If you press **run** now, you will see that nothing happens! Your job is to help Nuvi complete the code for this game!

Click the **fork** button to create a copy of the code for yourself to work on. Any activities under the **Activity** sections will be done in this browser tab. You will do these activities on your own, but help is available when you are stuck.
