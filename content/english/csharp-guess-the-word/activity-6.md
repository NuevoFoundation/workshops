## Let's do this!

Now, let's finally address the bug that was introduced in **Activity 4.2**. 

The game should continue to ask the player to guess letters if they have some lives remaining, and they have not yet won the game. Look at the `for` loop. As you might have noticed, even though you might have lives remaining, the game abruptly stops after only 3 guesses. We will replace this `for`-loop with a `while`-loop, with the correct looping condition. Use the given hint to complete the activity.
