## Writing to Console

`Console.WriteLine` means to tell the computer to print the sentence enclosed within the parentheses `()` out onto the console.

## Working Together

1. In the Fiddle program below, press **run**. You see that `Hello World` is printed out to the screen on the right.
2. Without removing the quotation marks, try changing `"Hello World"` to another sentence. Press **run** to see if anything changes.
3. Add another `Console.WriteLine` below the current line to print a second sentence below the first sentence.
4. Press **run** to see if two sentences are printed out. If you see any red text, please ask for help.

We will use printing heavily in the later lessons, so make sure you understand this before continuing!

## HELP! I got a lot of red text!

If you see any red text, you have encountered some errors! Please ask for help or check the debugging page at the end of this tutorial. Beware of the following when coding in C#:

1. The `c` in `Console`, and the `w` and `l` in `WriteLine` are capitalized.
2. There is a semicolon `;` at the end of the line.
3. Make sure the sentence you wish to print is surrounded in quotation marks, and that the sentence is between the parentheses.
4. Do not delete any curly braces `{` or `}`.
