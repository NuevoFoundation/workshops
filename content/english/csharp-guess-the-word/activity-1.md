## Instructions

Go to the code containing the [GuessTheWord](https://aka.ms/nuevoguesstheword.) game. Press **run**. Notice that `Press 'run' on the top of the screen to play again.` is the only thing that is printed to the console. Let's add a welcome message so that the player knows they playing the Guess the Word game.

Find `// TODO (ACTIVITY 1)` in the code. Add a line of code to print Welcome to C# GuessTheWord to the console. If you did this correctly, `Welcome to C# GuessTheWord` will be printed to the console after pressing **run**.
