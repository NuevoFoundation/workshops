# Animating the Player's Ship

To add some life to our game, let’s get things moving around! We will start with animating the player's ship. These are relatively easy to do in Phaser. The reason we used a sprite sheets for the player (and not simply an image like the background) is so that each image in the sheet is a frame of animation! The animation works by cycling through this “sheet” of sprites quickly to imitate movement.

Animations in Phaser are created as an attribute in JavaScript. The syntax is shown below.

It looks a bit complicated, but this syntax is actually quite simple. The `key` is essentially the name of the animation. `frames` will take in what sprite we're animating (in this case, the player). The `frameRate` is essentially how fast we wish the animation to play. And finally, `repeat` will assign how many times this animation will loop around (a negative number will make the animation play infinitely).

The process we will use to implement the player's animation is to declare this animation attribute (shown above) in the `create()` method of `Scene1.js` (NOTE: not the `preload()` function like we used in the last activity):

Then we will play the animations by adding a line of code to the end of `create()` of `Scene2.js`. You can think of it like creating the animation's instructions in Scene 1 and actually playing those instructions in Scene 2:

`///// we need to edit the location of this in the repl to make it easier to find`

Once your ship is animated, it should look like this. Notice the flames coming out of the ship's engine! (although it may be faster or slower depending on the frame rate that you picked)

We will make one final touch to the animation - we will move the background as well. Even though it’s not a sprite sheet, we can still move because it is a tile sprite! (TileSprite is a type of Sprite with repeating texture, so it can be scrolled.):

Now try it! If it’s working properly, then it will look like the ship is flying through space!
