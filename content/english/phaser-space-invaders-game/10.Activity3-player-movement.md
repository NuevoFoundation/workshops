Now, let's allow our ship to move when the player uses the keyboard. The first step is to create a cursor attribute in the `create()` method in `Scene2.js`:

![create_cursor_key](../media/4/create_cursor_key.png)

The most efficient way to create movement is to create a helper function that uses the cursor attribute to check whether the keyboard has been pressed. We have already made this function for you, and it is called `movePlayer()`:

![move_player_function](../media/4/move_player_function.png)

We then move the player with this function. We can call this function in the `update()` method so that we check for movement during every update cycle (this has also already been done for you).

Now, go to the `movePlayer()` method, and write code that will check for movement and move the player accordingly.

{{% notice hint %}}

* we would recommend a movement speed of 200

* use an if statement

* after you've made the if statements, you may find that your player is continuing to move even after you've stopped pressing on the keyboard. To fix this, think: when the player is not pressing the keyboard, what should the ship be doing?

{{% /notice %}}

Now test it out! You may notice one thing however: the player is able to move outside of the screen like this:

![bounds](../media/4/player-off.gif)

This happens because Phaser uses on an unlimited canvas that exists even outside of the screenâ€™s window. We can fix this by restricting the player to the screen with one line of code:

```javascript
this.player.body.setCollideWorldBounds(true); // player cannot go out of screen
```

in the `create()` method of Scene 2:

![set_bound](../media/4/set_bound.png)

Now, that your player is bound within the screen, you should be able to move your ship like this:
