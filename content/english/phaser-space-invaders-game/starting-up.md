## Starting Up

Today you will be using Replit to learn how to code your Space Invaders game. Before starting, you will need to sign up for a Replit account, if you do not yet have one. 

Click the button below to sign up for a Replit account - you will need an email account in order to sign up. If you already have a Replit account, you can login to your account using the below button as well.

Next, launch the Replit console we will use today by clicking the below button. You should see the screen below.

We will now fork the Repl, which simply means to make a copy of the program, so that we can make our own changes to it. Click on the "Fork Repl" button on the top right, and then the "Fork Repl" button.

After forking the Replit, you will see a window similar to the one below:

For now, we will ignore the content of the project (the code), and we will instead go over the basics of how to use the website. On the left hand of the screen, you will see a list of files that contain code, or instructions for the computer to run. By pressing the run button, you tell the computer to perform the instructions in the code. Any results from running the code will be displayed on the right side, called the console.

If you press run now, you will only see a black screen. This is because the code is not yet completed - this will be your job! Any activities under the Activity sections will be done in this browser tab - so keep it handy!
