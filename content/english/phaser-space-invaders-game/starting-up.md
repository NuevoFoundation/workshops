## Starting Up

To begin, open your preferred internet browser (such as Edge, Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer), and go to <a href="https://repl.it/@nuevofoundation/Phaser-Space-Invaders#index.html" target="_blank">https://repl.it/@nuevofoundation/Phaser-Space-Invaders</a>. Your screen should look like this:

For now, we will ignore the content of the project (the code), and we will instead go over the basics of how to use the website. On the left hand of the screen, you will see a list of files that contain code, or instructions for the computer to run. By pressing the run button, you tell the computer to perform the instructions in the code. Any results from running the code will be displayed on the right side, called the console.

If you press run now, you will only see a black screen. This is because the code is not yet completed - this will be your job!

Click the fork button to create a copy of the code for yourself to work on. Any activities under the Activity sections will be done in this browser tab.
