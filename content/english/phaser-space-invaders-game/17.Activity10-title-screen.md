# Adding a Title Screen

Now, we will put our separation of scene 1 and scene 2 to good use by adding a title screen to finish off our game!

This is very simple! we will first comment out `startGame() line` from the bottum of `create()` in `Scene 1`. We are going to use `startGame() fuction` to start game instead of start automatically as before:

![startGame()](../media/11/comment_out.png)

The console will go back to a black canvas. To make a title screen, we need to import the background screen and some text in `start page` section from scene 1:

![start_page](../media/11/start_page.png)

You can only create background as an image in `create()`, because images can only be moved in `update()` functions!

For the texts, We would recommend different `font` and `fills` for title text and start text.

Now, we will call the startGame() method only if the player clicks to start the game:

![on_click](../media/11/on_click.png)

Your screen should look similar like this:
![title_screen](../media/11/title_screen.gif)

# Congratulates!

You have now compeleted all the lessons and created your own space invader game! Have fun with it!
