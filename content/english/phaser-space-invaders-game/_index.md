# Introduction

The goal of this lesson is to walk you through the creation of a game inspired by Space Shooters like Space Invaders and Galaga. You will also get a small taste of thinking about Object Oriented Programming.

All sprites in the Space Invaders game were created by Luis Zuno (aka Ansimuz). Check him out if you like the pixel art!

All sprites in the lesson repl with "dude" are from the Phaser website.

In the end, your game will look something like this:
