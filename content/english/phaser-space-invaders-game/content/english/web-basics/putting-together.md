# Putting it together
For your browser to understand what each element of your site is, we need to label them with HTML tags. HTML stands for `Hypertext Markup Language`. Tags are words surrounded by the symbols `<`and`>`. For example, the `<img>` tag tells your browser “this is an image.” The `<button>` tag tells it “this is a button.”

Tags can also be used to organize your webpage! The image below outlines the structure of a basic webpage. The head usually contains the additional libraries used and the page title, while the body contains most of the displayed content.

Most tags need an opening tag and a closing tag. For example, you will see all pages have an `<html>` opening tag at the top, and a closing `</html>` tag at the end. This tells the browser where the HTML elements start and where they end. Think of tags like quotation marks; for example, the computer will understand that everything in between the tags `<html>` and `</html>` is part of an HTML website.

There are also a few tags, like the image tag `<img>`, that are self-closing, meaning that they only need an opening tag, and do not need a closing tag.

Here is an example:

 <p class="codepen" data-height="500" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="Sunny-Dee" data-slug-hash="ErRraG" style="height: 500px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="HTML Basics">
