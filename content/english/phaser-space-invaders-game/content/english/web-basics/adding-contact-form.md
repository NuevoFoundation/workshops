Finally, we will add a contact form to let people reach us if they are interested in Benji.

Most browsers do not support sending emails directly from the contact form because it's an easy way for trouble makers to send spam to users. Spam is an irrelevant or inappropriate message sent over the internet. Therefore, to send a form, we will use a free service called [FormSpree](https://formspree.io/). If we want the messages in the contact form to go to our email, we will first need to confirm it with FormSpree. This confirmation method keeps bad actors from just putting down anyone’s email in a contact form and spamming the victim.
