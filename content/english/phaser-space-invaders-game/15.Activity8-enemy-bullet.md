# Allowing the Enemies to Shoot

Now, we will make the enemies shoot back at the player. Each enemy will shoot randomly, and the difficulty (which will later be escaleted with each level) is defined by how often they randomly shoot.

The enemy bullet is rather similar to the playerâ€™s bullet. We will again make a very similar enemyBullet.js file with nearly the same code as the playerBullet.js but with different variable names and numbers. We will also use the same sprite and animation for the enemy's bullets. However, during implementation, you will create a separate group for enemy projectiles, and you will have to call the EnemyBullet.js's update() method separately.

To make the enemies shoot randomly, we will create an enemyShoot() method (that is called in the update() method) that creates a new enemy bullet at a specified random rate.

In the end, it gameplay should look something like this:
