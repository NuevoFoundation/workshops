Now, let's allow our ship to move when the player uses the keyboard. The first step is to create a cursor attribute in the `create()` method in `Scene2.js`:

<!--- ![create_cursor_key](../media/4/create_cursor_key.png) --->
<img src="../media/4/create_cursor_key.png" alt="create_cursor_key" style="width:950px;"/>

The most efficient way to create movement is to create a helper function that uses the cursor attribute to check whether the keyboard has been pressed. We have already made this function for you, and it is called `movePlayer()`:

<!--- ![move_player_function](../media/4/move_player_function.png) --->
<img src="../media/4/move_player_function.png" alt="move_player_function" style="width:950px;"/>

We then move the player with this function. We can call this function in the `update()` method so that we check for movement during every update cycle (this has also already been done for you).

Now, go to the `movePlayer()` method, and write code that will check for movement and move the player accordingly.

{{% notice hint %}}

* We would recommend a movement speed of 200
* Use an if statement
* After you've made the `if` statements, you may find that your player is continuing to move even after you've stopped pressing on the keyboard. To fix this, think: when the player is not pressing the keyboard, what should the ship be doing?

{{% /notice %}}

Now test it out! You may notice one thing however; the player is able to move outside of the screen like this:

<!--- ![bounds](../media/4/player-off.gif) --->
<img src="../media/4/player-off.gif" alt="bounds" style="width:100px;"/>

This happens because Phaser uses on an unlimited canvas that exists even outside of the screenâ€™s window. We can fix this by restricting the player to the screen with one line of code:

```javascript
this.player.body.setCollideWorldBounds(true); // player cannot go out of screen
```

Find the `create()` method of Scene 2:

<!--- ![set_bound](../media/4/set_bound.png) --->
<img src="../media/4/set_bound.png" alt="set_bound" style="width:950px;"/>

Now, that your player is bound within the screen, you should be able to move your ship like this:

<!--- ![animation spaceship and background](../media/4/player-move-example.gif)
 --->
<img src="../media/4/player-move-example.gif" alt="animation spaceship and background" style="width:300px;"/>
