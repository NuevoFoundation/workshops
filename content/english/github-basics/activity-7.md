# Room 7: The Automation Alley

{{< figure src="../images/room7_actions.jpg" title="A room filled with gears and conveyor belts representing automated workflows" >}}

You step into a room buzzing with activity. Gears turn and conveyor belts move, symbolizing automated processes. A holographic display flickers to life: "Automate your way to victory!"

## Your Mission

1. Create a simple GitHub Action workflow.
2. Trigger the workflow by pushing a change to your repository.
3. View the results of the automated process.

## Instructions

1. In your local repository, create a new directory called `.github/workflows`.
2. Inside this directory, create a file named `hello-world.yml`.
3. Add the following content to the file:

   ```yaml
   name: Hello World Workflow
   on: [push]
   jobs:
     say-hello:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Say Hello
           run: echo "Hello, GitHub Actions!"

    ```
4. Commit this file and push it to your GitHub repository.
Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to see the workflow run.
