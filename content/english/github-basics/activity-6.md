Creating a pull request is a way to propose changes you have made in your branch to the original repository. This is an essential part of collaborating on GitHub. In this activity, you will learn how to create a pull request.

## Your Mission

1. **Push Your Changes:**
   - Make sure you have pushed your latest changes to your GitHub repository by running:
     `git push origin <your_branch_name>`
2. **Navigate to Your Repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to your forked repository page on GitHub.
3. **Start a Pull Request:**
   - Click on the 'Pull requests' tab at the top of the repository page.
   - Click the green 'New pull request' button.
4. **Select the Branches to Compare:**
   - Ensure the base repository is set to the original repository and the base branch is set to 'main'.
   - Compare it to your branch where you made changes.
5. **Create the Pull Request:**
   - Add a title and description for your pull request.
   - Click the 'Create pull request' button.

## Instructions

- Review the changes being proposed in the pull request before submitting.
- Communicate your changes clearly in the description to help reviewers understand your contribution.
- If your pull request is related to an existing issue, reference it in the description using '#' followed by the issue number.

## Next Steps

You have successfully created a pull request. The next activity will guide you on how to handle merge conflicts in pull requests.

If you're having trouble with the pull request:
- Ensure all your changes are pushed to your branch on GitHub.
- If you don't see your branch, try refreshing the page or selecting it from the branch dropdown.
- If you can't create a pull request, check if there are any restrictions set by the repository owners.
