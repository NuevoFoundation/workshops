Welcome, brave adventurers, to the mystical realm of CodeTopia! Here, you'll embark on an enchanting quest alongside two legendary digital knights, Maria and Kyle. Though you hail from different corners of this vast digital world, your paths are destined to intertwine in the quest for the fabled Code Crystal. 🌟🌲🏰

In this realm, sending scrolls (files) through mystical portals (Discord, Teams, email) can be quite the trial, but fret not! GitHub, the ancient and powerful tool of CodeTopia, shall be your guiding star in this coding odyssey. 🧭✨

Prepare thyself to delve into the secrets of GitHub, for it is time to unite with Maria and Kyle and commence your grand adventure...
