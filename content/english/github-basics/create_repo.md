A **repository** in GitHub is like a Folder on your computer: it is a place to store all of your files/work for a project. Think of them as treasure chests holding all your project files. With Git, everyone on your team can work on their copy of the project and merge their discoveries later!

There are two different ways to create a repository in GitHub:
1. Click on the plus sign on the top right corner of the page, then select "New Repository":

2. Or, on the left side of your page, there is a little green button with a small drawing of a book, next to the word "New":

Once you have clicked on one of the options above, you will get to the page below:
- Here you can enter a name for the repository and a description of what is in it. Below the description is an option to make your repository "Public" or "Private", meaning you can have other people of GitHub see your repository or just have it to yourself.
- Lastly, you can add a "README" file if you would like, but you do not need to.

- Now click on the green button "Create repository" to finish.

Congratulations! You have now created your first repository! Refresh your page, and it should look like the "test" in the photo below.
