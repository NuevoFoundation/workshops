Once you have created your own repository, the next step is to fork an existing repository. Forking allows you to create a copy of another user's repository to your GitHub account. This is a common way to start contributing to open-source projects.

## Your Mission

1. **Navigate to the Repository:** Go to the GitHub repository you wish to fork. For example, use the following URL: `https://github.com/VerisimilitudeX/escape-room`.
2. **Fork the Repository:**
   - At the top right of the repository page, click the 'Fork' button.
   - Wait for GitHub to create your fork. You will be redirected to your new forked repository.
3. **Check Your Repository:**
   - Make sure your GitHub username appears as the owner of the repository.
4. **Prepare for Cloning:**
   - Click the green 'Code' button to see the clone options.

## Instructions

- Review the structure of the forked repository.
- Take note of the branches available and the number of stars or forks to understand its popularity.

## Next Steps

Now that you have forked the repository, the next activity will guide you on how to clone this repository to your local machine for further work.

If you're experiencing issues:
- Ensure you're logged into your GitHub account.
- Check your internet connection, as forking requires a stable connection.
- If the fork button is grayed out, you may not have the necessary permissions. Try logging out and logging back in.
