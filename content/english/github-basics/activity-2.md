# Room 2: The Commit Conundrum

<img src="../images/room2_commit.jpg" alt="Code snippets float around a central terminal, waiting to be organized" />

As you enter the second room, snippets of code float in the air. A terminal in the center flickers with a message: "Bring order to chaos. Commit your changes to proceed."

## Your Mission

1. Create a new file called `solution.md` in your local repository.
2. Add the secret code from Room 1 to this file.
3. Stage and commit your changes.

## Instructions

1. In your terminal, ensure you're in the `escape-room` directory.
2. Create the file and add the code:

```
echo "Secret Code: GITHUB_BASICS_101" > solution.md
```

3. Stage and commit your changes:

```
git add solution.md
git commit -m "Add solution for Room 1"
```
