You awaken in a dimly lit room. A pedestal in the center holds a glowing GitHub logo. A voice echoes: "To proceed, you must fork the path ahead."

By path, the voice means a GitHub repository. Forking creates a copy of the repository in your account, allowing you to make changes without affecting the original copy.

## Your Mission

1. Create a GitHub account (if you haven't already).
2. Fork the repository: `https://github.com/VerisimilitudeX/escape-room`
3. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

## Instructions

1. Go to GitHub and sign up or log in.
2. Navigate to the repository URL and click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner.
3. Once forked, click the green "Code" button and copy the URL.
4. Open your terminal and run:

   ```pwsh
   git clone <YOUR_FORKED_REPO_URL>
   cd escape-room
   ```

**Hint:** Look for the `README.md` file in your cloned repository. It contains a secret code to unlock the next room!

If you're stuck, try these steps:

1. Make sure you're logged into GitHub.
2. Check that you've navigated to the correct repository URL.
3. If you're having trouble with git commands, make sure that [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is installed on your system.

Note: The actual input field and encryption functionality would need to be implemented separately, as Hugo doesn't provide this out of the box.
