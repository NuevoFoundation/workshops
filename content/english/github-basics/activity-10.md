# Room 10: The Deployment Den

<img src="../images/room10_pages.jpg" alt="A room with a giant screen displaying a website and floating deploy buttons" />

You enter the final room to find a giant screen displaying a website and floating "Deploy" buttons. A triumphant voice announces: "Deploy your victory for all to see!"

## Your Mission

1. Enable GitHub Pages for your repository.
2. Create a simple index.html file.
3. Push the file and view your deployed site.

## Instructions

1. Go to your repository's "Settings" tab.
2. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
3. Under "Source", select the branch you want to deploy (usually `main`).
4. In your local repository, create an `index.html` file in the root directory.
5. Add some HTML code to the file, like:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
     <head>
       <title>My GitHub Pages Site</title>
     </head>
     <body>
       <h1>Hello, GitHub Pages!</h1>
       <p>I've completed the GitHub Adventure Game!</p>
     </body>
   </html>
    ```

6. Commit and push this file to your repository.
7. Wait a few minutes for GitHub to process your request, then visit your site at https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name> where <username> is your GitHub username and <repository-name> is the name of your repository.
