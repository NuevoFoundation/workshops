In the final room, Nuvi finds a magical mirror that can display web pages. It's time to share your adventure using GitHub Pages!

### Task:
1. Create a new branch called `gh-pages`.
2. Add an `index.md` file with a summary of your GitHub learning adventure.
3. Configure your repository to use GitHub Pages from the `gh-pages` branch.
4. View your published site and share the URL.

### Clues:
- Go to your repository settings to enable GitHub Pages.
- Your adventure log will be accessible at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>`.
- Use Markdown in your index.md file to format your adventure summary.
