Congratulations, brave coders! You've successfully set up your GitHub repository – the headquarters for your coding expedition with Maria and Kyle. 🎉🏰

Now, it's time to stock your repository with precious files and enchanted code! Let's learn the two ways to add files to it! ✨📂

First, go into your new repository, click on the "Add file" button, and select "Create new file".
- Now you can name your new file and start coding! Below is a photo of a file created by Maria to say hello to Kyle:

# Your GitHub Repository Blooms! 🌱🏞️

With your newfound abilities, your GitHub repository will flourish, each file a magical blossom in your coding garden! 🌷🌼

As you and your companions continue your coding quest, remember to add and commit your changes often. This way, you'll be able to go back in time and view your code in the past.

So, let your creativity flow, and watch your GitHub repository bloom with the fruits of your coding adventures! 🚀🌟
