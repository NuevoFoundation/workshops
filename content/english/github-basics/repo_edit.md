Now that you have created your repository, let's learn the two ways how to add files to it!

First, go into your new repository, click on the "Add file" button, and select "Create new file".
- Now you can name your new file and start coding! Below is a photo of a file created by Maria to say hello to Kyle:

- After you've finish coding, scroll down to the bottom of the page and you will see this:
