# Room 9: The Security Stronghold

{{< figure src="../images/room9_security.jpg" title="A room filled with locks, shields, and security monitors" >}}

You enter a room bristling with security measures. Locks, shields, and security monitors surround you. A stern voice declares: "Secure your code to proceed!"

## Your Mission

1. Enable Dependabot alerts for your repository.
2. Add a security policy to your repository.
3. Run a code scanning alert using GitHub Actions (if your repository is public).

## Instructions

1. Go to your repository's "Settings" tab.
2. Click on "Security & analysis" in the left sidebar.
3. Enable Dependabot alerts.
4. In your repository, create a new file at `.github/SECURITY.md`.
5. Add basic security guidelines to this file.
6. If your repository is public, enable code scanning in the "Security & analysis" settings.
