Understanding collaboration workflows is key to successfully working on projects with others on GitHub. Different teams may use different workflows based on their structure and needs. In this activity, you will learn about a few key workflows.

## Your Mission

1. **Familiarize with Workflows:**
   - **Centralized Workflow:** All team members commit changes directly to the main branch of the repository. This is simple but can lead to frequent merge conflicts.
   - **Feature Branch Workflow:** Create a new branch for each feature and merge it back into the main branch after review. This keeps the main branch stable.
   - **Git Flow Workflow:** A more structured approach with distinct branches for features, releases, and hotfixes. This facilitates organized releases and maintenance.
2. **Choose a Workflow for Your Project:**
   - Discuss with your team to decide which workflow suits your project.
