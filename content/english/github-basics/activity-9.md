Nuvi enters a room with various locks and security systems. It's time to learn about securing your code!

### Task:
1. Enable Dependabot alerts in your repository settings.
2. Add a SECURITY.md file to your repository with basic security guidelines.
3. Run a code scanning alert using GitHub Actions (if your repository is public).

### Clues:
- Look for the "Security" tab in your repository.
- Dependabot helps you keep your dependencies up-to-date and secure.
- The SECURITY.md file should explain how to report security vulnerabilities.
