Nuvi discovers a chaotic room filled with scattered tasks and deadlines. It's time to bring order using GitHub Projects!

### Task:
1. Create a new project in your GitHub repository.
2. Set up columns for "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done".
3. Create a few issues and add them to your project board.
4. Move an issue across the different columns.

### Clues:
- Use the "Projects" tab in your GitHub repository to get started.
- Try both the classic and new project views to see which you prefer.
