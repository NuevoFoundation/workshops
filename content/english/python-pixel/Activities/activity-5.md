In the last section, we saw an example on creating a blue filter and thought about how to create the grey filter. Now, let us create our grey filter together.

### Example - Create a grey filter
<hr/>

Let us change the origin cat below with our grey filter together!!!
<img src="../../media/cat.png" width=50%>
(<b>Hint:</b> We changed the 10th code and achieved the grey filter.)

```python
#We need to import PIL package to manipulation with pixels.
from PIL import Image
#Open the cat image
img = Image.open("cat.png")
#Grey filters
for i in range(img.size[0]):    # for every col:
    for j in range(img.size[1]):    # For every row
            color = img.getpixel( (i,j) )
            #Hightlight: Get color: GREY
            GREY = (color[0] + color[1] + color[2]) // 3
            img.putpixel((i,j),(GREY, GREY, GREY))# set the colour accordingly
#Save the cat after filtering
img.save("Mycat.png")
```
Wow! This is our cat after the grey filter.

### Example - Partial filter
<hr/>

Now, let us think about how to add filter on only part of our lovely cat.

```python
#We need to import PIL package to manipulation with pixels.
from PIL import Image
#Open the cat image
img = Image.open("cat.png")
#Grey filters
for i in range((img.size[0] // 2)):    # for first-half cols:
    for j in range((img.size[1] // 2)):    # For first-half rows
            color = img.getpixel( (i,j) )
            #Hightlight: Get color: GREY
            GREY = (color[0] + color[1] + color[2]) // 3
            img.putpixel((i,j),(GREY, GREY, GREY))# set the colour accordingly
#Save the cat after filtering
img.save("Mycat.png")
```
Wow! This is our cat after the filter. We only filtered one-forth of the cat on the upper left corner！

### Challenge - Create your own partial filter
<hr/>

It's now your turn to filter whichever part you want with different kinds of filters on the cute cat! Exciting！
