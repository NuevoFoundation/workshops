One other thing we can do to enhance our image is to add text. We can do that by utilizing the `Pillow ImageDraw` module. Let’s import that at the top of our file along with our other import statements.

```python
    from PIL import Image
    from PIL import ImageFilter
    from PIL import ImageDraw
```

To allow us to add text, we must redraw the same image we used earlier. Let’s do that using the `draw()` function, which takes in an image object. Once the image is drawn, we can then add text to it by using the `text()` method to set the text of the image. The text is drawn based on coordinates provided. The function takes in two mandatory parameters: the xy coordinates and the text needed.

For example:

```python
    drawnImage = ImageDraw.Draw(img)
    drawnImage.text((200,20), "When you realize you learned python in an hour.")
    drawnImage.save("myCatWithText.jpg")
```


My image now looks like this:
<img src="../../media/meme.png" alt="blurred black and white cat upside down with text that says `when you realize you learned python in an hour.`" width=50%>

### Challenge - Change the font
You can see that the text in the image created above is in a small, default font. There are other parameters within the `text()` method you can use. Take a look at the [documentation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/ImageDraw.html#PIL.ImageDraw.PIL.ImageDraw.ImageDraw.text) and see if you can change the font and the font size, as well as the color of the text!
