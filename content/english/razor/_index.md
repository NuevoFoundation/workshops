## Welcome

The goal of today's activity is to learn Web and C# skills and incorporate your new-found knowledge to create a web site!

## Starting Up

The goal of today's activity is to learn Web and C# skills and incorporate your new-found knowledge to create a web site! Let's get your environment set up.

Before you get started with C# application development, your first step is to select a programming environment. For this workshop, we've chosen Visual Studio Code, one of the most popular IDEs among C# developers. 

### Download Visual Studio Code
1. Open a new browser window, and then navigate to: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank">https://code.visualstudio.com</a>.

2. In the browser window, select Download button.

The Download page for Visual Studio Code automatically detects your operating system. It displays the version to download for your operating system, such as Linux, macOS, or Windows.

3. Wait for the installer file to finish downloading.

The name of the installer file will be similar to the following (for a Windows PC): VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.81.0.exe.

The file name depends on the current version of Visual Studio Code and your computer’s operating system.

4. Close your browser window.

### Install Visual Studio Code
1. On your PC, open a file explorer application, and then navigate to your computer’s downloads folder.

2. In your file explorer application, select and run the Visual Studio Code installer file.

    On a Windows PC, you can double-click the installer file to begin the install process. For example, double-click VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.81.0

{{% panel theme="info" header="Note"%}}
You can install Visual Studio Code using either the User Installer or System Installer. The User Installer installs Visual Studio Code just for the current user, while the System Installer installs Visual Studio Code for all users. The User Installer is the recommended option for most users.
