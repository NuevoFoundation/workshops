A driveshaft will experience two types of loading when a car is running, torque and moment. Torque is a measure of the force that can cause an object to rotate about its axis.

That rotational force comes from the engine, which then driveshaft translates that to the wheels. A higher amount of torque will allow the car to accelerate much faster. So that range can be anywhere from 0 all the way to 10,000. This is taken from some actual torques of actual cars. But go ahead and select any of the following as the appropriate minimum and maximum torque. This being 0, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000, 10,000.

Driveshafts also experience bending, which makes the shaft bend upwards or inwards to forces. These forces will also impact the performance of the shaft. Feel free to also select from a range of 0 - 10000 just like from torque.
