The goal of the workshop is to have students understand how engineers create real life projects through a procedure called the Design Process. The students will learn what the Design Process is, how it is used, and its purpose and relevance towards creating big projects. Upon learning the basics, the students will visualize the Design Process through a fictional and virtual racing competition, called DISTANCE. Using the Design Process will assist students to design an important part for their “racecar”, where they get to briefly experience the thought processes of an actual engineer!

Note that the students will not be actually physically building anything throughout this workshop, this activity simply provides a fictional simulation through a programming language called MATLAB **(TO FIX)**.

## The San Diego Student Racing Competition (DISTANCE):

The San Diego Student Racing Competition (DISTANCE) is a fictional student racing competition that takes place every year during the summer in San Diego, California. This “competition” is meant to have students visualize and experience the engineering concepts they will learn in this workshop. DISTANCE invites teams consisting of highschool students across the county to create their own cars from the provided resources and budget of their school. You are a member of your school’s racing car team, and you have been invited to participate in this exclusive competition. 
Of course, building a car from scratch consists of many components: body, engine, transmission electrical work, interior, etc. Before any actual hands on work begins, the first phase is to do research and go through the Design Process to think of what kind of car they want to create.
