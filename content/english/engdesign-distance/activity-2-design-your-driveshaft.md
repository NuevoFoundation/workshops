Your task is to design a driveshaft for your racing car. Design means to create something or an idea by following a series of steps. Your team is asking you to design a driveshaft with a specific diameter size, meaning with a specific thickness. A remaining question is what makes a good shaft thickness?

You will use your calculated shaft thickness to determine the success of your car. If your driveshaft is too big, then it will occupy too much space in your car and start bumping into other parts. If your driveshaft is too small, then it wonâ€™t be able to provide as much rotational power or even worse it might just break! 
So what makes a good diameter for a driveshaft? After you attain a size from using MATLAB **(TO FIX)**, you will then check to see how well it will perform
