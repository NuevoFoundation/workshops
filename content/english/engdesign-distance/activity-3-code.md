## MATLAB Introduction

MATLAB is an incredibly useful programming language for engineers. In this activity, students can incorporate all steps from the Design Process into MATLAB to attain fast and organized solutions for their problems. The solution will be the minimum diameter calculated within the program. 
Recall that the Design Process is the following a sequence of steps to attain a solution. This process parallels the studentâ€™s task of designing a driveshaft. This is meant to inform students that the Design Process is useful for any design project. The advantage of using programming is that students can get a solution towards their problem with just a few clicks on their computer, and can redo the process as many times as they wish. This is a much more practical way compared to conducting the same tasks by hand which will take more time and be prone to mistakes.

## Install Octave

MATLAB is a paid subscription, so students will follow instructions to install a free version of MATLAB called Octave. Download the following instructions to install Octave Below [Insert File titled: Octave Instructions.docx]
