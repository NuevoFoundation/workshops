In this activity, we will have a program that prints out the game board and gaming prompt, like the output below:

```
<<<~  Tic  Tac  Toe  ~>>>
* Choose number 1 - 9 to place your move
* Player: 'X' Computer: 'O'

 1 | 2 | 3 
---+---+---
 4 | 5 | 6 
---+---+---
 7 | 8 | 9 
Enter your move (1-9): 2
 O | X |   
---+---+---
   |   |   
---+---+---
   |   |   
Enter your move (1-9): 
```

## The Main Class and Main Method

Notice that in the starter code, we have the class `Main` and the `main()` method. `main()` method is where the program starts whenever we click the `Run` button.

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
  }
}
```

## Print Statements

 In `main()`, write print statement(s) to print the welcome statement and rules for the game!

```
<<<~  Tic  Tac  Toe  ~>>>
* Choose number 1 - 9 to place your move
* Player: 'X' Computer: 'O'
```

## Variables and Arrays

In this game, note that we will have to track the symbol currently in each of the 9 positions on the board.

   Hence, we will need to store 9 pieces of data in the program. Let's use an `array` (a data structure) of size 9 to store these.

   As stated in the rules, on the game board, `"X"` is the player's move, `"O"` is a computer move, and `" "` is an available spot.

   To do this, let's declare an array `variable` called `board` with the value `" "` String in all 9 positions (i.e `{" ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " "}`).

## Displaying the board

Now we have the variable `board` storing current symbols on the game board, let's try to print out an empty game board using print statements (shown below).

Note that each game board consists of 5 lines, so it is reasonable to have 5 print statment to print out each board.

Each of the 9 blocks is a `String` of length 3, where the middle character is the current symbol stored in `board` at the corresponding position.

You should have a program that has the output below after completing this step.

```
<<<~  Tic  Tac  Toe  ~>>>
* Choose number 1 - 9 to place your move
* Player: 'X' Computer: 'O'

   |   |  
---+---+---
   |   |  
---+---+---
   |   | 
```

## Methods

As we know we will need to print out the current game board several times throughout the game, so it will be a good idea to move the block of code you write in step 4 to a method. 

This method should take an input of `String[]` and prints out the current board. Note that this method should be written outside of `main()`.

Let's write a method with the following header:

```java
public static void printBoard(String[] curBoard);
```

## Calling Methods

In `main()`, call the `printBoard()`, so it prints the initial board with labelled position. You can do this by creating another `String array` with the content `"1", "2", ..., "9"`.

Have a line of code that prints `Enter your move (1-9): `

```
<<<~  Tic  Tac  Toe  ~>>>
* Choose number 1 - 9 to place your move
* Player: 'X' Computer: 'O'

 1 | 2 | 3 
---+---+---
 4 | 5 | 6 
---+---+---
 7 | 8 | 9 
Enter your move (1-9): 
```
