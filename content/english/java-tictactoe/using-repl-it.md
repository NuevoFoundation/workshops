Before we start, let's first understand how the window works. The `Main.java` file contains code, or instructions for the computer to run. By pressing the **run** button, you tell the computer to perform the instructions in the code. Any results from running the code will be displayed on the bottom screen, under the **Console** tab.

Click the icon next to the `Run` button that says `open in repl.it`. This will be the window where you will type all the code for the TicTacToe program. Have fun!
