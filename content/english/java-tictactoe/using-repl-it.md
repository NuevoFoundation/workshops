## Using Replit

Today you will be using Replit to learn how to code in Java. Before starting, you will need to sign up for a Replit account, if you do not yet have one. 

Click the button below to sign up for a Replit account - you will need an email account in order to sign up. If you already have a Replit account, you can login to your account using the below button as well.

Next, launch the Replit console we will use today by clicking the below button. You should see the screen below.

We will now fork the Repl, which simply means to make a copy of the program, so that we can make our own changes to it. Click on the "Fork Repl" button on the top right, and then the "Fork Repl" button.

After forking the Replit, you will see a window similar to the one below:

Every time you see the "Launch Replit" button, you will need to follow the above steps to fork the repl in order to complete an activity. Ask for help if you are having trouble with forking the repls!

Before we start, let's first understand how the window works. The `Main.java` file contains code, or instructions for the computer to run. By pressing the **run** button, you tell the computer to perform the instructions in the code. Any results from running the code will be displayed on the bottom screen, under the **Console** tab.

Click the icon next to the `Run` button that says `open in Replit`. This will be the window where you will type all the code for the TicTacToe program. Have fun!
