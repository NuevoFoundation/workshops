### Let's make the computer think

Previously, we used a `Random` object to randomly generate a move for the computer. As a result, the competitiveness of the computer is fairly low.

In this exercise, we want to increase the difficulty of the game by making optimal decisions for the computer.

We will do so by adding artificial intelligence into our program with the use of the **Minimax** algorithm (a well-defined procedure that allows computers to solve problems).

### Minimax Algorithm

Minimax is an algorithm that is used in two-player games to make optimal decisions for a player.

- The two players are labeled as <b>maximizer</b> and <b>minimizer</b> respectedly. While the maximizer maximizes its chance to win, the minimizer tries to minimize its loss.
- The algorithm examines all the possible future game states based on the current game board assuming both the maximizer and minimizer will pick the move that benefits them the most.
- In our case, we pick the computer to be the maximizer, and the player to be the minimizer. We will attempt to make optimal decision for the computer by maximize its chance to win!

### How will Minimax Algorithm work in TicTacToe?

- We examine all the possible moves of `"X"` and `"O"` and give a score to a game board if there is a winner or tie.
- Since we want the computer to win with the fewest steps possible, we design the score for the game boards as the following: 

- If computer wins, calculate the score with the formula `1 * (number of available spots on the board + 1)`.
- If the player wins, calculate the score with the formula `-1 * (number of available spots on the board + 1)`.
- If there is a tie, the score is `0`.
- Note that by giving larger scores to game states where the computer can win with fewer steps, we are teaching our code to pick the optimal move for the computer. 

Let's look at an example below:

<img src="../images/minimax.png" height="500" alt="example of possible options for winning tic-tac-toe as desribed in the text below." /> 

1. In the first row, we considered the 3 possible moves for the computer `"O"`, who is the maximizer.
2. We examine all the game states until all the moves end will a computer win, player win, or a tie. We then give them their corresponding score.

    For example, in the second board in row 1, the computer wins by placing `"O"` at position 8. That state will then be given a score of `1 * (number of available spots on the board + 1)` = `1 * (2+1)` = `3`.

3. At game states that don't have a winner or a tie, we pick the smallest score during minimizing rounds (when `"X"` make a move), and the largest score during maximizing rounds (when `"O"` make a move).
4. If you follow along through the maximizing/minimizing rounds on the picture above, you should note that the optimal move for the computer is to place `"O"` at position 8, allowing the computer to win with 1 move from the starting game board.

### Code Structure

In activity-3, you wrote the method `int getComputerMove(String[] curBoard)` to randomly generate a spot for the computer. Let's write another method called `getComputerMoveAI(String[] curBoard)` that returns the optimal move for the computer by calling the `int minimax(String[] curBoard, boolean isMaximizing)` method.

```java
int getComputerMove(String[] curBoard){
    // 1. this method calls minimax() on all the possible moves the computer can pick
    // 2. it takes the maximum out of all of them
    // 3. return the optimal move
}
int minimax(String[] curBoard, boolean isMaximizing){
    // 1. In the maximizing round, it calls minimax() on all the possible moves for the computer, "O", return the maximum score
    // 2. In the minimizing round, it calls minimax() on all the possible moves for the player, "X", return the minimum score
}
```

{{% notice note %}}

- The method `minimax()` is a <b>recursive function</b>, which means that the function calls itself inside of the implementation of itself.
- In our method, `minimax()` call itself with different possible boards by placing `"X"` or `"O"` at each available spots. And, the method pick either maximum or minimum score depending on whether its a maximizing round.

### Write the Method `getComputerMoveAI()`

1. For each available spot on the game board, place `"O"` at that spot and get the score for that board by calling `minimax()`. 

{{% notice hint %}}

- Note you should pass `false` for the second argument since it'd be the minimizer's turn.
- You should change that spot back to `" "` after getting the score, so you maintain the original state of the game board during the next iteration.

2. Track the largest score and its corresponding position of the board at each iteration. Return the position with the largest score.

{{% notice hint %}}

- Have a variable called `bestScore` that stores the current best score and have an initial value of `Integer.MIN_VALUE` (minimum value of an integer).
- This is an useful way to find the maximum value in a data structure. 
For example:

```java
public int getLargestNum() {
    // the following code find the maximum value in the array "nums"
    int[] nums = {3, 5, -2, 10};
    int largestNum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
        if(nums[i] > largestNum){
            largestNum = nums[i];
        }
    }
    return largestNum;
}
```

### Write the Method `minimax()`

As we discussed above, the `minimax()` method has the header `int minimax(String[] curBoard, boolean isMaximizing)`.

1. Call `getWinner()` on the board to check if there is a winner. If so, return the corresponding score.

    (Score: computer wins (`1 * number of available spots on the board + 1`), player wins (`-1 * number of available spots on the board + 1`), tie (`0`)).

2. Get Minimax Score

- If it's maximizer's turn (`"O"`), for each available spot on the game board, place `"O"` at that spot and get the score for that board by calling `minimax()`.

- If it's minimizer's turn (`"X"`), for each available spot on the game board, place `"X"` at that spot and get the score for that board by calling `minimax()`.

3. Return Largest Score

- If it's maximizer's turn (`"O"`), track the largest score and the corresponding position at each iteration, and return that score.
- If it's minimizer's turn (`"X"`), track the smallest score and the corresponding position at each iteration, and return that score.

### Update the Program

After testing the methods, update all the method calls of `getComputerMove()` to `getComputerMoveAI()` in your TicTacToe program.

It should be way more challenging to win this time aroundðŸ˜€!
