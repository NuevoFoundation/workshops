## 1. Displaying a Winner
Write a method `getWinner(String[] curBoard)` that returns the winner in a `String` with an `array` input of the current game board. 

- If the player wins, return `"Congratulations! \nYou won the Game :)"`.
- If the computer wins, return `"Game Over! \nYou lost the Game :("`.
- If there's a tie, return `"It's a TIE! Try again"`.
- If there isn't a winner yet, return `""`.

There are several ways to write this method. 

Give it a try in the following repl.it first; it will tell you if your method is correctly written!

#### Ideas/Hints for writing the method `getWinner()`
- Concatenate `Strings` at the 3 positions that consist a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
- Use `equals()` to check if each of the concatenated Strings is `"XXX"` or `"OOO"` for a winner. (You can even create another method that checks if an input `String` is `"XXX"` or `"OOO"`)
- If all the spots in the array is filled (a `for loop` can be helpful) and there is no winner, the game ends in a tie.

## 2. Calling the Winner Method 
In `main()`, call the method `getWinner()` after the line of code where you place the player's move, `"X"`. 

Check if the game should continue (when there is no winner or a tie). 

If there is a winner or a tie, print out the final board and the game result! And, add the line of code `break;`, which prompts the program to break out from the `while` loop!

</br>

## 3. Repeat Step Two
In `main()`, repeat the code in step 2 (check winner and print result if needed) after you place the computer's move, `"O"`.

</br>

## 4. Close the Scanner Object
Outside of the while loop, add the code `sc.close()` to close the `Scanner` object from reading any new inputs. 

It is good practice to close the `Scanner` object if we won't be getting any more inputs after we `break` from the `while` loop!

</br>

## 5. All Done :) !
You should now have a functioning TicTacToe game! I am so proud of you to finish this workshop! Good Job üëç!
