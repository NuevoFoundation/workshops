# Activity 6
You have come a long way; we hope you are enjoying this workshop!

In this activity, you need to apply your knowledge of 'if' control structures you learned in the Python basics workshop. 

Find `// TODO (ACTIVITY 6)` in the code. We introduced an `'if'` block on purpose that has the wrong condition for tracking the score when the right paddle misses the ball. This not only causes the wrong score to be displayed on screen; it causes the ball to move in an erratic manner. Can you figure out what 'condition' the `'if` block should check for when the right paddle misses the ball? Ask the person beside you, or the workshop staff, if you need help.

You may need to check the boundary value for the horizontal position (represented by 'X' axis) of the ball when the right paddle misses it. Can you guess what value it should be? Press **run** to confirm the result.

## Takeaway 
You have just fixed a condition for checking boundary values when ball moves horizontally out of the game boundary.
