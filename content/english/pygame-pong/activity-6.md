# Activity 6
You have come a long way, we hope you are enjoying!

In this activity you need to apply the knowledge about 'if' control structure you learnt in Python basics. 

Find `// TODO (ACTIVITY 6)` in the code. We have on purpose introduced an `'if'` block that is checking for wrong condition for tracking the score when right paddle miss the ball. This not only causing the wrong score to be displayed on screen , as well as it causing the ball to move in erratic manner. Can you figure out what 'condition' it should check for when right paddle miss the ball ? Feel free to ask if you need help in getting this right.

You may need to check the boundary value for horizontal position (represented by 'X' axis) of ball when right paddle misses it. Can you guess what value it should be ? 
Confirm the result after pressing <b>run</b>

## Takeaway 
You have just fixed a condition for checking boundary values when ball moves horizontally out of boundary of game.
