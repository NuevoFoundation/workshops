You can adjust the boundary of the Pong game by adjusting the height and width of the rectangle that represents the boundary.

Go to the <a href="https://replit.com/@nuevofoundation/PongLessonStudent?v=1" target="_blank">code</a> containing the Pong game. Press **run**. Notice that the game's boundary doesn't seem look right - see the image below. Let's fix that in this activity, so that the game boundary looks better.

Find `# TODO (ACTIVITY 1)` in the code. Follow the instructions there to modify the `WIDTH` attribute of the `Pong` class. If you did this correctly, the boundary problem will be fixed. Press **run** to observe the result.

Try changing the values for height and width to see the effects of different values on the game's boundary.
