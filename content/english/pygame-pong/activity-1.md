# Activity 1
You can adjust the boundary of pong game by adjusting the height and width of the rectangle that represents the boundary. 

Go to the code containing the Pong game. Press **run**. Notice that the game's boundary doesn't look right - see the image below. Let's fix this in this activity, so the game boundary looks good.

Find `// TODO (ACTIVITY 1)` in the code. Modify the `WIDTH` attribute of `Pong` class. If you did this correctly, the boundary problem will be fixed. Press <b>run</b> and observe the result.

{{% notice tip %}}

<h5>Try changing the values for height and width to see the effects of different values on the game's boundary.</h5>

{{% /notice %}}


## Takeaway 
You have just modified one of the attributes in `Pong` class to influence how the game will look on screen.
