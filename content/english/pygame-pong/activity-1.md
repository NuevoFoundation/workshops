# Activity 1
You can adjust the boundary of the Pong game by adjusting the height and width of the rectangle that represents the boundary. 

Go to the code containing the Pong game. Press **run**. Notice that the game's boundary doesn't look right - see the image below. Let's fix this in this activity, so the game boundary looks good.

Find `// TODO (ACTIVITY 1)` in the code. Modify the `WIDTH` attribute of `Pong` class. If you did this correctly, the boundary problem will be fixed. Press <b>run</b> and observe the result.

Try changing the values for height and width to see the effects of different values on the game's boundary.

{{% /notice %}}


## Takeaway 
You have just modified one of the attributes in `Pong` class to influence how the game will look on screen.
