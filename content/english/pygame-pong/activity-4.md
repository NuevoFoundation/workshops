# Activity 4
Now you know how to change key assignments to control a paddle's movement. Great work!

We have added movement for the left paddle. Can you apply the knowledge about the `Paddle` object and its attributes that influence its movement on screen to change the key assignment for the right paddle? 

Find `// TODO (ACTIVITY 4)` in the code. Modify the appropriate attribute value for the right paddle such that pressing the `'UP'` key moves the right paddle up.

## Takeaway 
You have just modified `up_key` attribute in `Paddle` class to influence how the right paddle object should move on screen.
