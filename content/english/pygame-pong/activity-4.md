# Activity 4
Now you know how to change key assignments to control a paddle's movement. Great work!

Can you apply the knowledge about Paddle object and its attributes that influence its movement on screen to change the key assignment for the right paddle? 

Find `// TODO (ACTIVITY 4)` in the code. Modify the appropriate attribute value for the right paddle so it accepts 'UP' key for upward movement of the right paddle.
