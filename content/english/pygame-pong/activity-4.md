# Activity 4

Now you know how to change key assignments to control a paddle's movement. Awesome work!

We have added movement for the left paddle. Can you change the key assignment for the right paddle using your knowledge of the `Paddle` object and its attributes that influence its movement on screen?

Find `# TODO (ACTIVITY 4)` in the code. Modify the appropriate attribute value for the right paddle such that pressing the `'UP'` key moves the right paddle up.

## Takeaway

You have just modified the `up_key` attribute in the `Paddle` class to influence how the right paddle object should move on-screen.
