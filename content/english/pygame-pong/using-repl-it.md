To build our game, we will use the Pygame library, which provides a set of readymade functionality that we can use to build Pong and its animations.

## Using Replit

Today, we will be using Replit to build the Pong game.

If you would like a recap on how to use Replit, check out our <a href="https://workshops.nuevofoundation.org/python-basics/repl-it/" target="_blank">Python basics tutorial</a>.

Now, let's go through some of the code that has been provided to you in the `main.py` file.

## Libraries and import statements

Look at the top of the code. You will see the following line:

```
import pygame
```

This statement allows us to import all of the animation and object-drawing functionality provided by the `pygame` library. A **library** is a place where related functionality is grouped together for use in the Python language. For example, the `pygame` library provides a way to draw a rectangle on screen, which we can use to draw the boundaries, the ball, and the paddles used in Pong game.

## Comments

The gray line that starts with a `#` is called a **comment**. These are notes in the code that help to explain what the code does in normal English. Comments are ignored by the computer; developers use comments to communicate with each another, especially when several developers are working on the same code. Comments also allow someone who is looking at the code to get a high-level overview of what is happening without having to read all of the code.
In `main.py` we use comments throughout to indicate where changes to the code are required.
