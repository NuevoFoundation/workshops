To build our game we will use the Pygame library, which provides a set of readymade functionality that we can use to build video games and animations.

## Using Repl.it

Today you will be using Repl.it to build the Pong game.

If you would like to re-cap on how to use Repl.it. Checkout the following Python basics [tutorial](https://workshops.nuevofoundation.org/python-basics/repl-it/)

Next, let's explain further some of the code that has been provided to you in the `main.py` file.

## Libraries and import statements

Look at the top of the code. You will see the following line:

```
import pygame
```

This statement allows us to import all of the animation and object drawing functionality provided by the `pygame` library. A **library** is a place where related functionality are grouped together for use in the Python language. For example, the `pygame` library provides a way to draw a rectangle on screen, which we can use to draw the boundaries, the ball and the paddles used in Pong game.

## Comments

The gray line that starts with `#` is called a **comment**. These are notes in the code that helps to explain what is happening in plain English. As they are ignored by the computer, they are often used so that when other developers work on the same code, they will have an easier time reading and understanding what is going on.
In `main.py` we will use comments to walk you through the activities where we need you to make changes to build the game in correct form.
