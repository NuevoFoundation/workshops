# Activity 7
Time for final activity in this Tutorial; yay! You have done an awesome job to get here.

In this activity you need to change the way game exits anytime by pressing a given key combination. 

Find `// TODO (ACTIVITY 7)` in the code. Pygame library gives you a handy way by using `event` to detect what keystrokes are being pressed anytime during the life of program. 
Currently the game exits by pressing the `'BACKSPACE'` key. You should change it to exit by pressing `'ESC'` key on the keyboard.

If the value of `'BACKSPACE`' key in Pygame library is `K_BACKSPACE` then can you guess the value of `'ESC` key? Give it few tries before you ask for help. 
Confirm the result after pressing **run**.

## Takeaway 
You have just changed the way game should exit at any time while running.
