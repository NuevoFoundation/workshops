Great! You just fixed the game's boundary. Now, notice how everything inside the game looks black and white? Let's bring it to life by giving it some colors.

To do this, we need to modify the RGB values in the `COLOR` attribute.
RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue. On a computer screen, you can modify the color of each pixel by modifying its RGB value. You can make create about 16.7 million different colors just through a combination of different RGB values. The values are specified in same order as RGB is written. Use the color picker below to find the RGB values for your favorite color:
<input type="color" id="colorpicker" style="height:50px;width:50px">

Find `# TODO (ACTIVITY 2)` in the code. Modify the `COLOR` attribute of `Pong` class. If you did this correctly, the objects will acquire the desired color. Press <b>run</b> and confirm the result.
