***Great, now that the bad one won't cause us any more headaches, let's replace the old file so things will run smoothly again.***

**mv**

mv is a command that can move files from one location to another. If the destination is a filename, this will rename the file to that name in that destination.
mv [source filename] [destination name]

**cp**

cp is a command that copies a file from one location to another.
cp [source filename] [destination name]
