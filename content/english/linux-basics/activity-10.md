***Great, now that the bad one won't cause us any more headaches, let's replace the old file so things will run smoothly again.***

**How to fix the  secret-message**

The command mv replaces the destination file with the source file.
mv [source filename] [destination name]

Replace the messed up secret message with the old copy.

**Make a copy of the secret message**

cp is a command that copies a file from one location to another.
cp [source filename] [destination name]

Copy the secret message and put it in the directory you made.
