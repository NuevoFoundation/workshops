*Great, now that the hackers' malicious file won't cause us any more headaches, let's restore the old file so things will run smoothly again.*

### How to fix the secret-message

The command `mv` can also be used to replace the destination file with the source file.  
The format is: `mv [source filename] [destination name]`.

Replace the messed up secret message with the backup that we found earlier.  
Let's move the file into the new directory that we made.

### Backup your files

*That backup file earlier came in handy to fix the tampered file. Let's backup the files in our directory.*

`cp` is a command that copies a file from one location to another.  
The format is: `cp [source filename] [destination filename]`.

Make a copy of the file you made and the `secret-message.txt`.
