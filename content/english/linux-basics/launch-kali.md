Now that everything is installed, let's launch the virtual machine!

### Starting the vm
This is pretty simple using VirtualBox. Just double click on the vm that we created in the previous step and off you go!
![virtual box launch kali](../images/start-01.PNG?classes=border,shadow)

{{% notice tip %}}
As the virtual machine is getting started there may pop up some warnings like in this image.  
It is safe to ignore these.

![virtual box launch kali](../images/start-01.PNG?classes=border,shadow)
{{% /notice %}}

### Sign into the vm
First you will need to log in. Use these *credentials* to get started!

| Username | Password |
| :---: | :---: |
| nuvi | nuevo123 |

{{% notice warning %}}
The above is not good password security! It is simple just for this workshop.  
Please do not use simple passwords like this for your accounts!

### The Terminal
All our activities will be practicing <b>command-line interface</b> (CLI) skills.  
It is good to learn the CLI because it can be faster and more efficient than using a GUI.
GUI is the <b>graphical user interface</b>, which is probably what you are most used to using.
Go ahead and open up the terminal, another name for the CLI.
In Kali this application is called "Terminal Emulator".

![kali find terminal](../images/start-04.PNG?classes=border,shadow)

After clicking the button, the terminal should open like the image below.  
Once it is open, you are ready to get started with Linux!
