## What is a virtual machine
A **virtual machine** (commonly called a vm) is a computer file (called an `image`), that behaves like an actual computer.  
In other words, creating a computer within a computer. It runs in a window, much like any other program.  
This gives you the same experience on a vm as you would on a regular computer.

The vm is `sandboxed` from the rest of the system, meaning that the software inside a vm canâ€™t effect the computer itself.  
This produces an ideal environment for testing other operating systems, accessing virus-infected data, and creating new software or applications.
