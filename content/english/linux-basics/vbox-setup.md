*We are providing you with a copy of an **image** (see below for more details) to work with. You can download it here (insert link).*

## What is an image
Images come in a variety of types. We have photographs, which are images. The images in computers are very similar.  
Both are copies of things from a single point in time.

This means what we will be working with is a copy of the computer that has been acting weird.  
Don't worry though, this won't hurt your computer!

## What is a virtual machine


## Setting up VirtualBox
VirtualBox is a virtualization software, also called a **hypervisor**. It allows your computer to host virtual machines.

### Downloading VirtualBox
VirtualBox is available at this link: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

If you are using Windows:  
    Select "Windows hosts"  
If you are using Mac:  
    Select "OS X hosts"  
If you are using something else, we recommend using Windows or Mac for this workshop. As anything else is beyond the scope.

Next run the installer that just downloaded.

The default options will be good enough for today!  
Just keep clicking "Next" on the installer.

Note some option selections are on the third page.
