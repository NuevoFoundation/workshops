### What is a virtual machine?
A **virtual machine** (commonly called a VM) is a computer file (called an `image`), that behaves like an actual computer.  
In other words, creating a computer within a computer. It runs in a window, much like any other program.  
This gives you the same experience on a VM as you would on a regular computer.

The VM is `sandboxed` from the rest of the system, meaning that the software inside a VM canâ€™t affect the computer itself.  
This produces an ideal environment for testing other operating systems, accessing virus-infected data, and creating new software or applications.
