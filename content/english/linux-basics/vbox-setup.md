*We are providing you with a copy of an **image** (see below for more details) to work with. You can download it here (insert link).*

## What is an image
Images come in a variety of types. We have photographs, which are images. The images in computers are very similar.
Both are copies of things from a single point in time.

This means what we will be working with is a copy of the computer that has been acting weird.
Don't worry though, this won't hurt your computer!

## What is a virtual machine


## Setting up VirtualBox
VirtualBox is a virtualization software, also called a **hypervisor**. It allows your computer to host virtual machines.


### Downloading VirtualBox
VirtualBox is available at this link: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

If you are using Windows:  
    Select "Windows hosts"  
If you are using Mac:  
    Select "OS X hosts"
