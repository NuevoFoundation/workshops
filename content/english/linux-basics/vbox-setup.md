*We are providing you with a copy of an **image** (see below for more details) to work with. You can download it here (insert link).*

## What is an image
Images come in a variety of types. We have photographs, which are images. The images in computers are very similar.
Both are copies of things from a single point in time.

This means what we will be working with is a copy of the computer that has been acting weird.
Don't worry though, this won't hurt your computer!
