*We are providing you with a copy of an **image** (see below for more details) to work with. You can download it here (insert link).*

## What is an image
Images come in a variety of types. We have photographs, which are images. The images in computers are very similar.
Both are copies of things from a single point in time.

This means what we will be working with is a copy of the computer that has been acting weird.
Don't worry though, this won't hurt your computer!

## What is a virtual machine
A virtual machine (commonly called a vm) is a computer file (called an image), that behaves like an actual computer.  
In other words, creating a computer within a computer. It runs in a window, much like any other program.  
This gives you the same experience on a vm as you would on a regular computer.

The vm is **sandboxed** from the rest of the system, meaning that the software inside a vm canâ€™t effect the computer itself.  
This produces an ideal environment for testing other operating systems, accessing virus-infected data, and creating new software or applications.

## Setting up VirtualBox
VirtualBox is a virtualization software, also called a **hypervisor**. It allows your computer to host virtual machines.
