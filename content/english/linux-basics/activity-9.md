*So `malware.sh` is definitely a bad file, so we should probably remove it and the directory holding it!*

### Remove the bad file!

rm is a command that removes files.
rm [filenames]

Remove the file we have decided is causing our problems. Then let's try to use our previously learned commands to fix the file so that it looks like how it is supposed to.

### But what if we need to remove a directory?

rmdir is a command that can remove an empty directory.
rmdir [directoryName]

If you want an extra challenege try to remove the directory that the file we just deleted was stored in!
