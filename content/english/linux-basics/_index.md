An **Operating System** (OS) is a software which acts as an interface between you and the computer hardware. Every computer must have at least one OS to run other programs. The OS helps you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language.

Microsoft Windows is the OS you are probably most familiar with using at home. Another common one you might have seen is Mac OS from Apple. There are many options out there, but today we will using a Linux based OS, called Kali Linux. It is a popular OS for security experts and hackers!

The biggest differnce between Windows and Linux is what they are best at doing. Windows is really good for multimedia and games! Mac OS falls between Windows and Linux. It is great for multimedia too, but cannot play all the games. Linux is usually better for programming and hosting servers.
