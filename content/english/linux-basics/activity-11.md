*Thanks so much for helping us fix the machine! Now let's get everything up into one nice package.*

### Secure your files, so they don't get tampered with again

`tar` is a command that creates and extracts archived files.  
The format is: `tar [filenames]`.

| flags | Uses |
| :--- | :--- |
| -c | creates archive |
| -x | extracts archive |
| -f | creates archive with given filename |

Use `tar` to secure your directory of `files`! You are going to want to create an archive with the name `files.tar.gz`.
