*Now we are at the command line. Let's test a simple command to show us the user account.*

### What are user accounts?

Every user in Linux has a user account. These are used to uniquely identify each user.

### How do I find out which account I am using?

The Linux command `whoami` will tell you which account you are using.

Try it:
```
whoami
```

![home directory](../images/01_whoami.png?classes=border,shadow)

In our example above, the terminal output is the name of our user, `nuvi`. 

*Now that we checked who we are, next let's find out where we are.*
