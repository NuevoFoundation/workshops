*Now we are at the command line. Let's test a simple command to show us the user account.*

### What are user accounts?

Every user in Linux has a user account. These are used to uniquely identify each user.

For example, say you and your friend, Nuvi, share a computer. One way to track which files belong to each of you and make sure the other doesn't accidentally edit anything important, you and Nuvi could create separate user accounts. 

### How do I find out which account I am using?

The Linux command `whoami` will tell you which account you are using. Try it!

<!---![home directory](../images/01_whoami.png?classes=border,shadow) --->
<img src="../images/01_whoami.png" alt="home directory" style="width:600px;"/>

In our example above, the terminal output is the name of our user, `nuvi`.

*Now that we checked who we are, next let's find out where we are.*
