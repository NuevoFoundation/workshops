Welcome! This activity will show you how to find out which user account you are currently using. 

### What are user accounts?

Every user in Linux has a user account. These are used to uniquely identify users. Let's find out which user account we are currently using.

### How do I find out which account I am using?

Type in the Linux command, “whoami” to display the name on the current account.

![home directory](../images/01_whoami.png?classes=border,shadow)

In our example above, the terminal output is the name of our user, "nuvi." 
Now that we know who we are, we will use the next activity to find out where we are.
