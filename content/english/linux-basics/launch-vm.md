*Now that everything is installed, let's launch the virtual machine!*

### Starting the VM
This is pretty simple using VirtualBox. Just double click on the VM that we created in the previous step and off you go!

As the virtual machine is getting started there may pop up some warnings like in this image. It is safe to ignore these.

### Sign into the VM
First you will need to log in. Use these *credentials* to get started!

| Username | Password |
| :---: | :---: |
| nuvi | nuevo123 |

The above is not good password security! It is simple just for this workshop.  
Please do not use simple passwords like this for your accounts!

### The Terminal

All our activities will be practicing **command-line interface** (CLI) skills. It is good to learn the CLI because it can be faster and more efficient than using a GUI. GUI is the **graphical user interface**, which is probably what you are most used to using. Go ahead and open up the terminal, another name for the CLI.
In Kali this application is called the "Terminal Emulator".

After clicking the button, the terminal should open like the image below. Once it is open, you are ready to get started with Linux!
