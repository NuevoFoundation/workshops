## Make a Decision: If-Statement

Patrick üê• is a very polite duck who likes to greet everyone he meets with "Good Morning," "Good Afternoon," or "Good Night" depending on the current time.

As we learned before, we can print these statements as below:

```java
System.out.println("Good Morning");   // say it between 0:00 - 11:59
System.out.println("Good Afternoon"); // say it between 12:00 - 19:59
System.out.println("Good Night");     // say it between 20:00 - 23:59
```

However, we also know Patrick üê• should only decide to say one of these statements based on the current time.

In other words, we need to write code that makes a decision on what to print based on the conditions of the situation (conditionally).

In Java, we make a decision by using an **if statement** or an **if...else statement**. Read the notes below:

### If Statement

```
if(boolean expression){
    Action(s) to Take
}
```

An **if statement** follows the structure shown above. The actions to take (statements) in the block will only be executed if the boolean expression is `true`. Otherwise, the program will skip to the statement after the block if the Boolean expression is `false`.
### If-Else Statement

```
if(boolean expression){
    Action(s) to Take A
}else{
    Action(s) to Take B
}
```

An **if-else statement** follows the structure shown above. If the boolean expression is `true`, the program will execute the `Action(s) to Take A` within the `if` block. Otherwise, the program executes only `Action(s) to Take B` within the `else`-block.

### Example

```java
boolean likeMusic = true;
if(likeMusic == true) {
    System.out.println("I like Music");
} else {
    System.out.println("I don't like Music");
}
```

The code above will print the statement `I like Music` because the boolean expression, `likeMusic == true`, is true.

Let's revisit the greating example above, and make decision for Patrick on whether to say "Good Morning," "Good Afternoon," "Good Night". 

Patrick should say "Good Morning" between 0:00 - 11:59, "Good Afternoon" between 12:00 - 19:59, and "Good Night" between 20:00 - 23:59.

1. We have a variable `currentHour` that stores the current hour. 
2. Fill out the correct `boolean expression A` and `boolean expression B` to complete the program.
3. Test your result by assigning the variable `currentHour` to numbers from 0 to 23:

## Repeat It Again: For-Loop, While-Loop

In math class, Patrick's üê• teacher ask the class to solve a math challenge, and he might need some help. 

The teacher asks them to find the **sum of 1, 2, 3, ...., 100**. That is what is **1 + 2 + 3 + 4 ... + 99 + 100**?

While we can plug this into a calculator, that is gonna take a while. Thankfully, in Java, you can easily calculate this in 3 lines with the help of a **for loop** or **while loop**.

{{% notice note %}}
**For loops** and **While loops** are control structures in Java that allow you to execute blocks of code multiples times.

### While Loop

```
while(boolean expression){
    Action(s) to Take
}
```

`Action(s) to Take` in the while block will be executed as long as the `boolean expression` is `true`. 

The following is an example that prints out 1 through 10:

```java
int number = 1;
while(number <= 10){
    System.out.println(number);
    number = number + 1;        // number is incremented by 1
}
```

In the while loop above, the program will print out the value of `number` and increment `number`. This step will be performed as long as `number <= 10`, and in this case the loop terminates when `number` is 11.

**Note:** For `while` loops, you must remember to increment the conditional variable, otherwise you will introduce an infinite loop into your program.

### For Loop

```
for(initialization; termination condition; update statement){
    Action(s) to Take
}
```

In a `for` loop, there are three parts the in condition block: `initialization`, `termination condition`, and `update statement`.

1. When executing a for loop, the program will execute the `initialization` part. An example is, `int number = 1`.
2. Next, the program checks for `termination condition`. An example is `number <= 10`.
3. If it is `true`:
    1. execute the `Action(s) to Take` 
    2. execute the `update statement` (an example is `number = number + 1`) 
4. Repeat step 2 and 3.
5. If the `termination condition` is `false`, exit the `for` loop.

The following is an example that prints out 1 through 10:

```java
for(int number = 1; number <= 10; number = number + 1){
    System.out.println(number);
}
```

{{% /notice %}}

After learning about for loop and while loop, let's see how do we help Patrick üê• and calculate **1 + 2 + 3 + 4 ... + 99 + 100**  easily?

Let's try to do it in a while loop:

1. We have a variable called `total` that tracks the total addition sum we get so far.
2. We have a variable called `num` that tracks the next number to be added to `total`.
3. Write out the appropriate `boolean expression` and write out the while loop.

By following those step we will get a while loop like this:

```java
int total = 0;
int num = 1;
while(num <= 100){
    total = total + num;
    num = num + 1;
}
System.out.println("Answer calculated in a while loop: " + total);
```

Test this out below by clicking `Run` and write a for loop version that calculates the same thing! You should get the same answer!
