Welcome to the course <b>Java: Basics</b>, where you will learn a widely-used high-level programming language that gives computer instructions to create exciting programs!

Java is a high-level programming language developed by James Gosling and Sun Microsystems in California in 1995.

A high-level programming language is called high-level because it is quite a few steps away from the original code run on a computer's Central Processing Unit (CPU). High-level code is meant to be used by humans and is much easier to understand than low-level code. The high-level code is later translated into a low-level language, which can only be perceived and run by a specific CPU. For the code to work, every single line of code written in a high-level language must be translated into machine language before being implemented by the computer.
