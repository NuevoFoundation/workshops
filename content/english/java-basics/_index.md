## 0. Overview
Welcome to the Java: Basics course, where you will learn a widely used high-level programming language that gives computer instructions to create exciting programs!

Java is a high-level programming language developed by James Gosling and Sun Microsystems in California in 1995. And, in this course, we will cover all the basic features of the language.

## 1. Let the Program Speak! 

Let’s try to print `Hello World` out by typing `System.out.print(“Hello World”);` As you might have guessed, the program prints out whatever you typed in the parenthesis. And, each line of code ends with `;`.

After, add more statements to print numbers (i.e. `System.out.print(2020)`) or a symbol (i.e. `System.out.print(‘@’)`).

#### Do you notice that all the statements you typed end up printing everything in one line?
Sometimes we want to enter a new line when typing. 
And, to do that, we type a slightly different code `System.out.println();` 

(Note: we type `println` instead of `print` to create a new line after)

## 2. Print an Owl
Use what you just learn and recreate the owl below using just 4 lines of code! (Art credit: asciiart.eu/animals/birds-land)

## 3. Make a Comment
When creating a Java program, we can jot down some notes by adding one line comment using `//` or multi-line comment using `/*` and `*/` (Note: The instructions in the previous activities were written as comments). 

Also, adding comments will not affect the program whatsoever. So, you can add any notes with comments throughout your code!
