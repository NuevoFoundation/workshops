## 1. Let the Program Speak! 

Let’s try to print `Hello World` out by typing `System.out.print(“Hello World”);` 

As you might have guessed, the program prints out whatever you typed in the parenthesis. And, each line of code ends with `;`.

After, add more statements to print numbers (i.e. `System.out.print(2020)`) or a symbol (i.e. `System.out.print(‘@’)`).

#### Do you notice that all the statements you typed end up printing everything in one line?
Sometimes we want to enter a new line when typing. 
And, to do that, we type a slightly different code `System.out.println();` 

(Note: we type `println` instead of `print` to create a new line after)

## 3. Make a Comment
When creating a Java program, we can jot down some notes by adding one line comment using `//` or multi-line comment using `/*` and `*/` (Note: The instructions in the previous activities were written as comments). 

Also, adding comments will not affect the program whatsoever. So, you can add any notes with comments throughout your code!
