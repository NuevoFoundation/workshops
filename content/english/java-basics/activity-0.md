## Using Repl.it

Today you will be using Repl.it to learn how to code in Java. Here is an example interactive window that you will use today:

<iframe height="600px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@nuevofoundation/JavaBasicsTest?lite=true#Main.java" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>

Before we start, let's first understand how the window works. The `Main.java` file contains code, or instructions for the computer to run. By pressing the <b>run</b> button, you tell the computer to perform the instructions in the code. Any results from running the code will be displayed on the bottom white screen, under the <b>result</b> tab. 

Try and press the <b>run</b> button. If you see <b>Let's learn Java!</b>, that means you're ready. Let's get started!
