## Using Repl.it

Today you will be using Replit to learn how to code in Java. Here is an example interactive window that you will use today:

<iframe height="600px" width="100%" src="https://replit.com/@nuevofoundation/JavaBasicsTest?lite=true#Main.java" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>

Before we start, let's first understand how the window works. The `Main.java` file contains code, or instructions for the computer to run. By pressing the **run** button (the green button with the triangle in the middle at the top of the frame), you tell the computer to perform the instructions in the code. Any results from running the code will be displayed on the bottom screen, under the **Console** tab. 

In the Objects and Classes exercise, you will need to switch between the `Main.java` file and the `Birds.java` file. You can do this by clicking on the icon on the right that looks like a document. This will open the Files menu and will allow you to access the other files.

Try and press the **run** button. If you see **Let's learn Java!**, that means you're ready. Let's get started!
