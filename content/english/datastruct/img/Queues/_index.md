A restaurant might receive hundreds of orders at a time and has to prepare the food as quickly as possible to get it delivered to the customer.  It’s up to you how you want to store this information. A restaurant should start preparing the food on a first come first serve basis, as in a customer that ordered their meal an hour ago should be prepared long before a customer who placed their order only 10 minutes ago. We will implement this behavior by utilizing a queue.
