Anything that is surrounded by quotation marks is called a `string`. This is how a computer represents words or sentences. For example, `"a"`, `"2"`, `"banana!"`, and `"Hello World"` are strings, but `2` and `Hello World` are not strings, because the quotation marks are missing.

You can combine many strings together using the `+` sign.

For example:

- `"Apple" + "Pineapple"` produces the string `"ApplePineapple"`.
- `"Nuevo" + " " + "Foundation"` produces the string `"Nuevo Foundation"`.

What if you wanted to combine your first and last name? How would you do that?

# Activity 2

Delete all the `print` statements in your code. Start your code with the line `print("Nuevo" + " " + "Foundation")`

If you run it, you should get the following output:

    Nuevo Foundation

Letâ€™s try and find two more ways to print the string `"Nuevo Foundation"` using two plus (`+`) symbols in each `print` statement. Once you make this work, you should have "Nuevo Foundation" printed out 3 times. In other words, your console should look like this after you press run:

    Nuevo Foundation
    Nuevo Foundation
    Nuevo Foundation

Hint: The strings that you combine do not have to be real words! For example, `"Ap" + "ple"` will produce the string `"Apple"`. Ask for help if you are confused.
