It’s time to open repl.it and get creative!

You can continue working off Nuevo’s story line:

<iframe height="600px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@nuevofoundation/PythonGuessAdventureNuevoSample?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>

You can work on a template for a Choose Your Own Adventure game:

<iframe height="600px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@nuevofoundation/PythonGuessAdventureBlank?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>

Or you can start from scratch and make it your own! Just go to repl.it and start story telling!
