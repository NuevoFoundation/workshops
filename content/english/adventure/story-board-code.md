It’s time to open Replit. Now it is time to create, let’s get creative!

You can continue working off Nuvi’s story line:

You can work on a template for a Choose Your Own Adventure game:

<iframe height="600px" width="100%" src="https://replit.com/@nuevofoundation/PythonGuessAdventureBlank?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>

Or you can start from scratch and make it your own! Just go to Replit and start story telling!
