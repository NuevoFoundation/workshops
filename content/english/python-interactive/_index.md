## Introduction
In this project, we're going to create a fun console application that allows the user to order from a restaurant based on their menu. So go ahead and choose your favorite restaurant/fast-food place and let's get started!

First step: Open up a new Replit document and create a `main()` function definition and function call.

Note: If you're unfamiliar with Repl.it, take a look at the Python Turtle's Using Replit page for more information.
