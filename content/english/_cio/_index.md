# Writing 



## What is Our Goal?

Often, the hardest part of developing software is not *how* to code, but *what* to code. We will be coding a simple program that can read and write data to a file in C. 

## Workshop Goals
This workshop will introduce you to C and teach you how to read and write data to files with the C standard library. You'll also learn how data is stored in computers and have the opportunity to develop your own file extensions!
