# Trouble at 



## What is Our Goal?

Often, the hardest part of developing software is not *how* to code, but *what* to code. So, we need to first visualize what we are building. In this workshop, we will create a system that takes some data from an imaginary game, and writes it to a file. We'll then build a way to read that file. First, we'll first need to learn a bit of C syntax. Then, we'll design how we'll write data to a file and implement that idea in code. We will do the same for reading data in the file.

This approach to software development is called the Waterfall methodology. We start from *what* we want to build, creating requirements for it. Then, we create designs for those requirements. Finally, we code and test at the end.

## Workshop Goals

By the end of this workshop, you will know how to use C to code a simple program. Hopefully, you'll also learn one of the many ways to design software!
