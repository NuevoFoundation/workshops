A chatbot is a computer program that simulates human conversation to answer questions.

## History of chatbots
Chatbots have been around for a long time. The first chatbot was created in 1966 and was called ELIZA. In 1995, a new chatbot called ALICE was created. ALICE was written using AIML, which is the same language we will learn in this workshop.
