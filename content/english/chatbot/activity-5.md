## Echoing Wildcards
Let's use the wildcard ```*``` and ```<star />``` tag together to allow our bot to include user input in its response. 

1. If the user enters "My name is [name]", the bot should respond with "Nice to meet you, [name]!".
Examples:
Input | Output
---|--------------
My name is John | Nice to meet you, John!
My name is Jane | Nice to meet you, Jane!
My name is Bob | Nice to meet you, Bob!

2. If the user enters "My favorite color is [color]", the bot should respond with "I also like [color]!".
Examples:
Input | Output
---|--------------
My favorite color is blue | I also like blue!
My favorite color is red | I also like red!
My favorite color is green | I also like green!

3. If the user enters "My favorite food is [food]", the bot should respond with "[food]! Yum!".
Examples:
Input | Output
---|--------------
My favorite food is pizza | pizza! Yum!
My favorite food is pasta | pasta! Yum!
