## Introduction
In this workshop, you will learn how to create your own chatbot. By the end of the workshop, you will have a chatbot that can have a simple conversation with the user.

In order to complete the workshop, you will need an email address to sign up for a Pandorabots account.

## What is a chatbot?
A chatbot is a computer program that simulates human conversation to answer questions.

## History of chatbots
Chatbots have been around for a long time. The first chatbot was created in 1966 and was called ELIZA. In 1995, a new chatbot called ALICE was created. ALICE was written using AIML, which is the same language we will learn in this workshop.
