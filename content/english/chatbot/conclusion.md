## Wrap Up
We have built a simple chatbot with just a few categories. Now you should be able to have a short conversation with your chatbot! Say "hi", tell it about your favorite food, color, and name, and ask it some questions. 

If you want to explore more, try adding more categories to your bot so that it can respond to more things.

Remember ALICE? It was built with 50,000 categories! And some larger chatbots have over a million. So you can imagine how much more complex they are.
