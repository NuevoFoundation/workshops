One of the fences broke loose in the farm and all the chickens and hens escaped! Because of this, we’re short on eggs and we now have to change the max capacity of eggs from 24 to 15. ☹ 

Can you calculate what the new cookie quantities should be? How much did your profit change due to the shortage?

Hint: Change the cell that has the capacity constraint for the eggs from 24 to 15, and then re-run the Solver! You won’t have to change anything in Solver if you set up your formulas correctly, you’ll only need to change the cell value.
