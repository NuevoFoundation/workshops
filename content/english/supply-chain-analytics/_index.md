> A supply chain moves a product or service from supplier to customer. It is the people, activities, information, and resources which move the product.

Example: Your parents pack you a yummy sandwich to take to school for lunch the next day. Here’s what it takes to make that happen:
1.	Farm grows the wheat
2.	A facility turns that wheat into flour
3.	A factory bakes that flour into bread
4.	A delivery truck will take that bread from the factory and deliver it to the sandwich shop.
5.	A chef makes the sandwich for you using that bread
6.	You (the customer) goes and buys that sandwich!


This might sound simple. After all, when you’re craving a sandwich, all you have to do as the customer is go to the store and pick one off the shelf. You might not think of all the things that go on behind the scene - and there’s a lot of them. Here’s some examples of roles:
