Great job! You are now able to successfully identify which category an image most likely falls under. 

To verify that your code is correct up to this checkpoint, please compare your code against the example code provided below.

{{% notice warning %}}
The outputs of the code may vary. You only need to copy the code blocks, and __not__ the output blocks, as they will be generated automatically in your notebook.

Before moving on, please check your Google Colab notebook against the code below:



```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10,10)) #sets the image size to 10x10 pixels
for i in range(25): #displays first 25 images with their class name
    plt.subplot(5,5,i+1)
    plt.xticks([])
    plt.yticks([])
    plt.grid(False)
    plt.imshow(train_images[i], cmap=plt.cm.binary) 
    plt.xlabel(class_names[train_labels[i]])
plt.show() #shows images with their labels

```

```python

Now that we are able to classify the category of an individual piece of clothing using your model, we will now visualize these predictions by creating a bar plot for a specified image.
