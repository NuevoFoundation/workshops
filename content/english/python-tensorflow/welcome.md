Hey there, congratulations! You have been hired at a appearel returns processing warehouse for the summer!

Your job is to take returns of clothing and sort them based on the type of clothing they are. At orientation, your supervisor shows you the traditional, by-hand method to sorting this clothing. On your first day, you notice it is more time consuming than you expected. Not wanting to do more work than you have to of course, you convice your superviors that you can devise a more efficent method using machine learning. 

You will grab some sample pieces of clothing and hop on to your computer and get to work on this program...
