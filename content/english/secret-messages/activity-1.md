We first need to enter a message, for our program to be able to create secret messages.

To do that we are going to start by telling the computer to show in console for whom is that message. This is the command that we will be using.

```
cout << "Hello Developer!" << endl;
```

Lets get into detail with this line of code, shall we?

### Strings

Everything that we see wrapped in quotation marks ("") will be called a String. A String is sequence of characters, numbers, letters or symbols.

`"Hello Developer!"` is the String in the line of code that we wrote before. Other String examples could be `"123"`, `"abc!"` or `"Hello"`. Please note that `123`, `abc!` or `Hello!` Are no Strings since they are not wrapped between quotation marks.

### Print to Console

To print into console we use `cout`. If we hit Run, `Hello Developer!` will be shown, since is the String wrapped inside the command line. Every `cout` will be followed by `<<` and `endl` that means the end of the line.

Copy the above line and paste it in the `main.cpp` file that we had at the beginning, Run and see what happens. Try changing the String to `"Hello world!"` or `"For the queen"`.

### Help! 

In case that after clicking the Run button, an error message in red shows, it means that there is something wrong with your code. Please ask for help to your instructor.

In the meantime you could check for:

1- Do not use caps.
2- Make sure that you add a semicolon after each line of code.
