Her presence there has come to an extend since she is doing important negotiations for the nation. But their messages have been compromised!

They have come with a plan on creating a system for the Pirates to not being able to understand their conversations, but they need help to do this.

You´ve been selected by the King to be the next Court Developer, and create and encryption system that would allow both him and the Queen to communicate without being intercepted by the Pirates. Will you help the King? The kingdom´s future is at your hands.
