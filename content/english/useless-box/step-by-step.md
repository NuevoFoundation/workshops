### Time to start building Nuvi a house!

1. Let's place the 12 wires into the breadboard. All the same-colored wires should go in the same rows, as follows:

	Note that the ranges below represent the rows and columns of the breadboard. We need to insert the end of each of the wires in any of the slots in the ranges specified below.
	1. Yellow: 26F - 26J 
	2. Green: 23F - 23J 
	3. Blue: 20A - 20E 
	
	Hint: Place the battery pack's wires last.
	
	4. Red: 1F - 1J
	5. Black: 1A - 1E

Now, it should look like this:

Here's a top view of the breadboard:

Here's a broader view of the same, where you can see the piece that has the motor and limit switch attached:

2. Now let’s be sure to test if it works before putting it in the box! We will need to flick the toggle switch (the red colored switch in the picture) and see the finger move forward. If you flick the toggle switch the other way, then the finger will move backwards. If the finger is moving backwards and you press the limit switch (the black colored switch in the picture), then the finger should stop. 

3. Let's put the circuit in the box! 
	1. Disconnect the battery pack’s red and black wires from the breadboard. 
	2. Insert the middle piece (#8) into the base acrylic piece (#1). Be sure that the motor is on the smaller half of the base (#1) and the finger (#9) is on the larger half. This will center the finger with the box.

	3. Insert the two side acrylic pieces (#2 and #3) into the side of the base (#1) as seen below:
	![sides attached to the box](../img/buildingTheBox2.jpg)
	4. Align the top with the toggle switch piece (#7) with the side pieces (#2 and #3). There is a nook at the end of the side pieces (#2 and #3) that the top piece (#7) will sit on.

	5. Repeat this step with the other top piece (#6) on the other side of pieces #2 and #3. There is a nook at the end of the side pieces (#2 and #3) that the top piece (#6) will sit on.

	6. Reconnect the battery pack’s wires to their appropriate rows on the breadboard (Red: 1F – 1J, Black: 1A- 1E from earlier suggestion). **Make sure that all red wires are in the same row and all black wires are in the same row.** 
	*Note: All same-colored wires should be in rows of their own in the same half section of the breadboard as each other. Remember only rows are connected with each other and the two vertical sections are totally disconnected from one another even if they are in the same row.*
	7. Place the battery pack snugly on its side in the box. It should be beside the motor and opposite the breadboard. Make sure no wires get disconnected in the process.
	8.Use the two end pieces (#4 and #5) to close the box. The hooks on the side pieces (#2 and #3) bend down to hook the end pieces into place and lock the box.

4. Your box is complete!

5. Flip the switch and make sure it works! Make sure no wires are in the way of the finger (#9) for when it moves up. 
*Hint: You might have to hold down the top piece (#6) across the top switch to make sure that Nuvi doesn’t get stuck when trying to flip the switch back.*

You have built a home for Nuvi!

### CONGRATS! You've done it. Feel free to play with your box and learn or experiment with more basic circuits.
