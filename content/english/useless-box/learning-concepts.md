## How do we make a "useless" box? Let's learn some basic concepts first!

### What will power the box? Batteries!
A battery is a chemical pump for electrons! There is a pair of chemical reactions that pump electrons from the [anode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anode) (negative end of the battery) to the [cathode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode) (positive end of the battery). 

The battery **voltage** is the potential energy given to electrons as a result of this pump.

An electron is a stable subatomic particle with a charge of negative electricity, found in all atoms and acting as the primary carrier of electricity in solids.)

You may be familiar with AA (double-A) batteries, that power many of our devices (or toys):

Voltage, measured in "volts", is always a measure of "the difference in potential energy" between two points. For example: charge at the top of the battery have 1.5V higher energy than the bottom.

What happens when you attach a light to a battery? **Current** flows.

But what is flowing?

Electrical charge. **Charge** is what makes components electrical. Charge can flow/move in material that conducts electricity, like wires. 
Moving charge is called **current**. We measure current in Amperes, usually called amps (A). 

### What triggers the action? Let's talk switches!
What is a switch? A switch is a component that uses a mechanical motion to change the conductivity between its terminals.

Switches in real life can look like this (ex. what turns the light on/off at your house):
![pictures of 4 different switches, like a light switch, metal switch, button switch and circuit switch](../img/differentTypesOfSwitches1.png)

Some switches have a default position, so they "connect" when you push them or switch them. Others may go back when you stop pushing them, like a keyboard.

1.	Momentary/limit switch: This will be used to detect when the finger is fully retracted.
2.	Toggle switch

Pushing the switch back and forth flips the rocker between one pair of contacts and the other.

### How do the pieces move? We need a motor!
The motor is what does the mechanical work to turn. It needs to be connected to something to move it. It also needs to get energy from somewhere, and that is?... the battery! 
The force of the motor depends on the current.
Connecting the battery pack to the motor will get it moving. 
(You can test the motor by connecting it to the battery and label the pins of the motor and the direction that the motor turns, depending on how they are connected (for example: A/B, A->B clockwise/counter clock wise)).
