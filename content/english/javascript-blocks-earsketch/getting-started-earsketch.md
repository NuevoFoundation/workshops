## Recommended for Teachers - Overview of EarSketch

Please take a look at overview of EarSketch before you start with the class. It is important to know how to navigate back and forth in the UI.

The `Content Manager` on the left side of the screen is your homebase for navigating through all that EarSketch has to offer.

1. The first item of the navigation bar is the `Sounds` collection. It is the central location for all the pre-loaded sounds that earsketch has to offer. In the sound browser, you can filter which sounds appear based on the artists, the genre, or instruments.

2. The next icon on the navigation bar is the `Scripts` pane. This is where we will write our code.

3. The last icon icons on the navigation bar is the `API Browser` pane. An *Application Programming Interface* or *API* is a set of code that is ready for you to use right away! When you click open, a detailed explanation of each API is provided.
