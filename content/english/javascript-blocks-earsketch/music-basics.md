## Basics first. A few things about music.

### What is Music?

[Music](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Introduction_to_music) is the chronological organisation of sounds; that is, making certain sounds at certain times, which make melodic, rhythmic and harmonic sense. The first, most basic concept, is keeping the sounds "in time". This leads us to some of the first few musical concepts: beat, rhythm, duration & tempo.

- **Beat** is the regular pulse which provides a `timeline` for the rhythm to anchor itself to.
- **Rhythm** is essentially repeated patterns of long or short, stressed or unstressed sounds or silences which fit into the main beat.
- **Duration** is the length of notes or sounds or silences which facilitate the rhythm.
- **Tempo** is the speed at which a piece of music is played.
