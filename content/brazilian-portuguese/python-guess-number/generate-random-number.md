Python includes a library called `random` that helps you generate random numbers. You can use this in your program by writing `import random` at the top of your program and using the `randint` function to generate a number between a range.

This would generate a random number between 1 and 10.
```python
    random.randint(1,10)
```

Try running the below code a few times to see what you get!

You can also play around by changing the range of random numbers. It's fun, give it a try!
