Meet our friend **Bob**. **Bob** is a nice and jolly gentleman. His hobbies are travelling and fishing.  One fine evening **Bob** received an email saying he won a free trip to the "Bahamas". **Bob** got excited. He immediately clicked the link to enter his personal details and waited for his itinerary to come. 

**Bob** decided to go shopping for his trip. He bought new clothes and a new fishing rod.

However, 24 hours later, he still didn't receive a confirmation for his trip. Another day passed and still nothing. The next day, he decided to go meet his good friend **Alice**.

**Bob** told **Alice** all about the email, the trip to Bahamas, his new clothes and how he cannot wait to go fishing. **Alice**, being a secret agent was suspicious, and asked **Bob** to show her the email.

On reading the email **Alice** sighed, "Bob you have been `phished`!"
