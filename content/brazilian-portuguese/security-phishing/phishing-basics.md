Our Secret Agent Alice explains to Bob about Phishing!!!

## What is Phishing?

Just like when fishing, one uses a bait to catch fish on a rod, malicious **hackers**
use different types of bait to steal personal information from unsuspecting people.

Phishing is a type of social engineering attack which is used to steal sensitive data, including login credentials, banking and credit card details.

It occurs when a **Hacker**, posing as a trusted entity, lures an individual using email, text message, or phone.

The recipient is then tricked into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the installation of a malicious software, or revealing of sensitive data.

## What went wrong?

Bob was enticed by an email from a hacker named Eve offering him a free trip to Bahamas to steal his personal
information.
