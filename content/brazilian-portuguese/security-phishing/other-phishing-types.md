Alice goes on to explain different kinds of phishing scams other than the email phishing. 

## Smishing (SMS Phishing)

Phishing conducted via Short Message Service (SMS), a telephone-based text messaging service. A smishing text, for example, attempts to entice a victim into revealing personal information via a link that leads to a phishing website.

download button. This can lead you to install a virus or a malware on your computer.

## Search Engine Phishing

Some phishing scams involve search engines where the user is directed to products sites which may offer low cost products or services. When the user tries to buy the product by entering the credit card details, the phishing site collects those details. There are many fake bank websites and fake product ads that are used to lure users into clicking a malicious link.
