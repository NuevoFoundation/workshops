# Nuevo Foundation Workshops

This repo contains all of the code and content for the [Nuevo Foundation Workshop website](https://workshops.nuevofoundation.org). 

## Website Links

* [Workshops website](https://workshops.nuevofoundation.org) - The site students use (aka production). This requires a manual push via Azure DevOps to push the master branch live. 
* [Workshops GitHub IO test site](https://nuevofoundation.org.github.io/workshops/) - The site workshop creators use to validate the content is rendering correctly (aka staging).  Updates to this page are pushed *automatically* when you change the master branch.
