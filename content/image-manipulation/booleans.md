Booleans are <font color="blue">True</font> or <font color="blue">False</font> statements. Unlike strings or numbers, <b>booleans</b> store statements of truth: is what I'm saying true or false? 

For example, if I say, "You are a robot", a boolean can store whether this statement is true. In this case, since you are not a robot (hopefully!), <font color="blue">False</font> would be stored. 

What are the boolean answers to these questions about you?

1. I am a human. _______
2. I have 25 fingers. _______
3. I like cookies. _______
4. My favorite color is blue. ______


Operator    |  Meaning
------------|----------
<           | Less than
>           | Greater than
<=          | Less than or equal to
>=          | Greater than or equal to
==          | Equal to
!=          | Not equal to


As usual, use <font color="blue">print</font> to print out your results to the following:

<pre>
    <font color="blue">print</font>(5 + 8 < 10)
    <font color="blue">print</font>((3 + 5) * 6) == (65 - 17)
</pre>

The first statement should return <font color="blue">False</font>. And the second should return <font color="blue">True</font>.
