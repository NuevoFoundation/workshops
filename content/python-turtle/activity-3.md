# Activity 3 - Drawing a hexagon

Great job! You just drew your first shape in Python with Turtle! Now let’s slightly change the code we already wrote to draw a square to instead draw a hexagon. Alex is a bee, after all, and he needs to draw hexagons to build his first honeycomb.

To help you draw a hexagon, think of how many sides a hexagon has. How many degrees are in each angle of a hexagon?
