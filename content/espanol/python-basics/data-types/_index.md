## Overview

In programming, data types are an important concept. Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

**Type** | **Example**
---------|-------------
Text |	str
Numeric | int, float, complex
Sequence | list, tuple, range
Mapping | dict
Set | set, frozenset
Boolean | bool
Binary | bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None | NoneType

In this section, we're going to focus on strings, numbers, and booleans. Let's get started!
