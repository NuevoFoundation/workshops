Using Replit Today, we will be using Replit to build the Pong game.
If you would like a recap on how to use Replit, check out our Python basics tutorial Now, let&amp;rsquo;s go through some of the code that has been provided to you in the main.</description></item><item><title>The Basics - Class and Object</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/pygame-pong/the-basics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2019 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/pygame-pong/the-basics/</guid><description>Classes and objects Before you start building a game, you should know how to draw different objects and modify them based on the way they need to look and move on computer screen.
In order to build objects, you need to first decide how they should look, what role they should perform in your game, and how player can control their movement on screen. You can do this by creating a class for each object you want on screen.</description></item><item><title>Activity 1 - Define the width of the Pong screen</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/pygame-pong/activity-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2019 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/pygame-pong/activity-1/</guid><description>Activity 1 You can adjust the boundary of the Pong game by adjusting the height and width of the rectangle that represents the boundary.
Go to the containing the Pong game. Press run. Notice that the game&amp;rsquo;s boundary doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem look right - see the image below. Let&amp;rsquo;s fix that in this activity, so that the game boundary looks better.
Find # TODO (ACTIVITY 1) in the code. Follow the instructions there to modify the WIDTH attribute of the Pong class.</description></item><item><title>Activity 2 - Change the color of objects in game.</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/pygame-pong/activity-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2019 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/pygame-pong/activity-2/</guid><description>Activity 2 Great! You just fixed the game&amp;rsquo;s boundary. Now, notice how everything inside the game looks black and white? Let&amp;rsquo;s bring it to life by giving it some colors.
To do this, we need to modify the RGB values in the COLOR attribute. RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue. On a computer screen, you can modify the color of each pixel by modifying its RGB value. You can make create about 16.</description></item><item><title>Activity 3 - Change the key assignment to move left paddle</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/pygame-pong/activity-3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2019 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/pygame-pong/activity-3/</guid><description>Activity 3 Kudos! You not only fixed the game boundary, but you were able to give color to objects too. Now, let&amp;rsquo;s see if you can change the keys for paddle movement.
To do this, we need to modify one of the parameters we passed in when creating the left paddle object. Remember from &amp;ldquo;The Basics - Class and Object&amp;rdquo; section, you defined the Paddle class with UP and DOWN key assignments as its attributes.</description></item><item><title>Activity 4 - Change the key assignment to move right paddle.</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/pygame-pong/activity-4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2019 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/pygame-pong/activity-4/</guid><description>Activity 4 Now you know how to change key assignments to control a paddle&amp;rsquo;s movement. Awesome work!
We have added movement for the left paddle. Can you change the key assignment for the right paddle using your knowledge of the Paddle object and its attributes that influence its movement on screen?
Find # TODO (ACTIVITY 4) in the code. Modify the appropriate attribute value for the right paddle such that pressing the 'UP' key moves the right paddle up.</description></item><item><title>Activity 5 - Declare and use a variable for font</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/pygame-pong/activity-5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2019 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/pygame-pong/activity-5/</guid><description>Activity 5 Great progress so far! Now let&amp;rsquo;s make use of a variable to change the font of the text in the game.
In this activity, you need to apply your knowledge about variables that you learned in the Python Basics workshop.
Find # TODO (ACTIVITY 5) in the code. Declare the variable font_label and assign it the value 'arial'. Now take a look at this statement in the code font_name = pygame.</description></item><item><title>Activity 6 - Fix the 'if' condition to track correct score.</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/pygame-pong/activity-6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2019 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/pygame-pong/activity-6/</guid><description>Activity 6 You have come a long way - we hope that you are enjoying this workshop!2
In this activity, you need to apply your knowledge of &amp;lsquo;if&amp;rsquo; control structures you learned in the Python basics workshop.
Find # TODO (ACTIVITY 6) in the code. We have created an 'if' block with a wrong condition for tracking the score when the right paddle misses the ball on purpose. This not only causes the wrong score to be displayed on screen - it also causes the ball to move in an erratic manner.</description></item><item><title>Activity 7 - Define the key combination to exit the game</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/pygame-pong/activity-7/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2019 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/pygame-pong/activity-7/</guid><description>Activity 7 Time for the final activity in this workshop; yay! You have done an awesome job getting here. You should be proud of yourself!
In this activity, you need to change the way the game exits anytime a given key combination is pressed.
Find # TODO (ACTIVITY 7) in the code. The Pygame library gives you a handy way to detect what keystrokes are being pressed while the program is running by using event .</description></item><item><title>Wrap up</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/pygame-pong/wrapup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2019 13:24:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/pygame-pong/wrapup/</guid><description>Congratulations! You made it! We are excited to see that you made it here! We hope that you had fun working on your game and learning concepts that will help you make even better games. Have fun with your game!
Now, it&amp;rsquo;s your turn! Use the knowledge you gained from this tutorial to make various interesting changes to the game.
Add rounds to the game, where a player wins a round once they reach 21 points.</description></item><item><title>Pygame Pong game - Answer Key</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/pygame-pong/answer-key/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Mar 2020 20:24:33 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/pygame-pong/answer-key/</guid><description>Activity 1 WIDTH = 800 # The value of WIDTH was 20 previously Activity 2 COLOR = (70, 130, 180) Activity 3 self.paddles.append(Paddle( # The left paddle self.BALL_VELOCITY, pygame.K_w, pygame.K_s, 0, self.HEIGHT / 2 - self.PADDLE_HEIGHT / 2, self.PADDLE_WIDTH, self.PADDLE_HEIGHT )) Activity 4 self.paddles.append(Paddle( # The right paddle self.BALL_VELOCITY, pygame.K_UP, pygame.K_DOWN, self.WIDTH - self.PADDLE_WIDTH, self.HEIGHT / 2 - self.PADDLE_HEIGHT / 2, self.PADDLE_WIDTH, self.PADDLE_HEIGHT )) Activity 5 font_label = &amp;#39;arial&amp;#39; font_name = pygame.</description></item></channel></rss>
