You can use this in your program by writing import random at the top of your program and using the randint function to generate a number between a range.
This would generate a random number between 1 and 10.
random.randint(1,10) Try running the below code a few times to see what you get!
You can also play around by changing the range of random numbers.</description></item><item><title>Create the game</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-guess-number/create-game/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-guess-number/create-game/</guid><description>Accept user input This game will use some of the concepts you learned in the Python Basics section. You will need to know how to use the following concepts. If you are not familiar with any of these, please go back to review them.
While loops Writing to console Reading from the console Conditional statements Random numbers You will need to code this game so that it randomly generates a number.</description></item><item><title>Python Guess The Number - Answer Key</title><link>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-guess-number/answer-key/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Mar 2020 20:24:33 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nuevofoundation.github.io/workshops/python-guess-number/answer-key/</guid><description>Playing with randit import random number = random.randint(1,100) print(&amp;#34;your randomly generated number is&amp;#34;, number) Create the &amp;lsquo;Guess the number game&amp;rsquo; import random #Use the random.randint() function here to generate a number #Also define the number of guesses you want to allow here randomNumber = random.randint(1,10) guessesLeft = 3 #Create a loop here that repeatedly asks the player for a number and compares it to the random number #Remember to decrease the number of guesses left so the player doesn&amp;#39;t get unlimited tries!</description></item></channel></rss>
